  abstract = {This paper presents the abstraction process to support a modular approach for simulating semiconductor supply networks by modelling each node in the network as a 'Functional Block'. In particular, a functional block to represent wafer fabrication facilities is developed, which strikes a suitable balance between a high level abstraction and modelling the detailed complexities of a manufacturing facility. We demonstrate that the model is able to produce performance estimates (average Cycle Time (CT) and Throughput (TH)) that resemble the behaviour of real-life systems and are accurate with respect to comparisons with a detailed Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model.  2007, Inderscience Publishers.},

  abstract = {Overcrowding at emergency departments in Hong Kong has been a critical issue for hospital managers recently. In this study, we focus on optimizing the medical staff configuration to alleviate overcrowding. According to the service requirements proposed by the Hong Kong government, 90% of urgent patients should receive treatment within 30 min. However, this condition is rarely satisfied in the practical situation. Therefore, we formulate the problem as minimizing the proportion of urgent patients that violate the service requirements while satisfying the service requirements of the other categories and cost constraints, thereby resulting in an optimization problem with a stochastic objective and several stochastic constraints. To solve this problem efficiently, we proposed a multi-fidelity simulation optimization framework containing a low- and a high-fidelity process. We utilize an evolutionary algorithm with violation-constrained handling assisted by a surrogate model as a low-fidelity process to shrink the solution space and generate an elite population. In the high-fidelity process, we exploit the optimal computing budget allocation method to identify the best solution in the elite population based on a data-driven simulation model. A case study is also discussed, and the results demonstrated that with a limited labor cost, there is a 52.05% reduction on average in the waiting time of urgent patients. Meanwhile, our proposed multi-fidelity simulation optimization framework proves to save 98.4% of the simulation time.  2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Simulation modeling (SM) is going to gain more interest due to the rise of Industry 4.0. Although, SM has been used extensively to analyze the behavior of complex manufacturing systems in a cost-efficient manner without disrupting the production process, it has many limitations that contradict with the industry 4.0 era. These limitations include; the large computational time, black-box characteristic, and not being able to directly run optimization analysis. Metamodeling combines the merits of SM and design of experiments by achieving optimal solutions at a limited computational time, and the ability to study complex systems with an explicit form and deterministic output. This paper proposes an architecture of a Decision Support System (DSS) based on a simulation metamodeling optimization approach to assist in making timely and informed decisions, using the emerging technologies of industry 4.0 and cyber-physical system concepts. The main modules and information flow path within the DSS are demonstrated in detail. To illustrate the applicability of the DSS, it has been implemented in a leading home appliance factory. The results indicate that this promising tool can easily be adopted in smart factories to aid in tactical and operational planning activities.  2018 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Cycle Time - Throughput curves (CT-TH), which plot the average cycle time versus start rate for a given product mix, are often used to support decisions made in manufacturing settings, such as the impact of proposed changes in start rate on mean cycle time. Discrete event simulation is often used to generate estimations of cycle time at a significant number of traffic intensities (start rates). However, simulation often requires long run lengths and extensive output analysis. In most manufacturing environments, the time and/or budget available for such simulations is limited. As demands for faster and more accurate results are required, alternative approaches to improving simulation efficiency must be investigated. This research seeks to develop a procedure for simplifying a detailed model into a fast (abstract) simulation model that achieves a statistically indistinguishable level of accuracy and precision. This technique has particular application in the simulation of semiconductor manufacturing facilities.},

  abstract = {Population-based algorithms can become computationally intractable when applying in practical engineering design optimization involving computational expensive simulation. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an on-line variable-fidelity metamodel (VFM) assisted Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms (OLVFM-MOGA) approach. In OLVFM-MOGA, the VFM integrates information from low-fidelity (LF) and high-fidelity (HF) models is constructed to replace the simulation model during the optimization process to ease the computational burden. Besides, a novel model updating strategy is developed to address the issues of 1) which individuals will be sent for running simulations. 2) whether the LF model or the HF model should be selected to run for a selected individual. The effectiveness and merits of the proposed OLVFM-MOGA approach are demonstrated on the design optimization problem of a torque arm.  2017 IEEE.},

  abstract = {In this paper a method is presented for mapping the simulation state between models of different level of detail in dynamic multiresolution modeling of discrete event material flow systems. In dynamic multiresolution modeling it is possible to inactivate a model part of certain detail and activate a model of higher or lower detail representing the same part of the system during simulation. To allow a consistent simulation, the state of the inactivated model has to be mapped to the activated model. The mapping is done by first mapping the jobs, then mapping the breakdown status and statistical variables. Experiments show that consistent states are generated, such that the simulation continues after state mapping. The errors generated by mapping are small and caused by the loss of information in the models of lower detail.  2011 IEEE.},

Mathematical programming approaches for stable tactical and operational planning in supply chain and APS context. Journal of Decision Systems, 17, 425-455) to be developed. Discrete events simulation is often used to build such an emulation tool, nevertheless this remains complex because of large-scale problems. The goal of this article is to propose a way to design a simulation model by reducing its complexity. According to the theory of constraints, we build reduced models composed exclusively of bottlenecks and a neural network. In particular, a multilayer perceptron is used. The structure of the network is determined using a pruning procedure. This study highlights the impact of discrete data on the computational results. An application to a sawmill internal supply chain is suggested to validate the proposed approach.  2011 Taylor & Francis.},

  abstract = {Production planning optimization remains a major challenge in almost all industries, particularly in high-tech manufacturing. A critical task to support such optimization is performance evaluation, wherein an accurate estimation of the cycle time as a function of the throughput rate plays a key role. This paper develops a novel aggregation model based on a queueing network approach, so-called queue-based aggregation (QAG) model, to estimate the cycle time of a job-shop production system that consists of several processing workstations, and in which products are transferred via an Automated Material Handling System (AMHS). The proposed model aggregates both production and automated material handling systems and provides an accurate and fast estimation of the overall cycle time. The performance and superiority of the proposed model is validated by comparing its results with those of a detailed simulation model. Numerous sensitivity analyses are performed to provide valuable managerial insights on both the production and automated material handling systems.  2019},

  abstract = {Since complex simulation contains many factors and responses that interact in a nonlinear manner, it is important to use metamodeling for representing the causal relationships within the simulation models in a compact way. With the selected mathematical structure, the effectiveness of metamodeling depends on the comprehensiveness of the training data that is closely related to the size of the scenario space and available computing resources. Generally, sequential experimental design methods are more efficient than one-shot ones, but the later depend on the domain knowledge of the experimenters and are uneasy to be conducted automatically. This paper proposes a sequential neighbor exploratory experimental design (SNEED) method for metamodeling purpose. Through the peaks function example, we compare this new method to Latin hypercube with a support vector regression metamodel trained by their training data respectively. The result shows that under the same experiment sample count, the SNEED method produces better regression performance. 2019 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

  abstract = {In this paper, a supply chain simulation testbed for the semiconductor industry is proposed. We start by identifying requirements for such reference datasets, and then we identify the main building blocks. The nodes of the supply chain that represent semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities (wafer fabs) are built on a simulation model from the measurement and improvement of manufacturing capacity project. We present two techniques to reduce the modeling and computational burden that are able to deal with load-dependent cycle times in single front-end and back-end facilities and in the overall network. The first method models in detail only the bottlenecks in the nodes of the supply chain, while the second one uses empirical distributions for cycle time and throughput. The quality of these reduction techniques is assessed by comparing the detailed model and the models with a reduced level of detail. We present an application scenario for the testbed by simulating a semiconductor supply network. In addition, the usage of the testbed is discussed.  2017 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Performance evaluation using queueing models is common practice in semiconductor manufacturing. Analytical closed-form expressions and simulation models are popular in capacity planning and the analysis of equipment configurations. However, the complexity of semiconductor processes complicates the modeling of the equipment. Analytical models lack the required accuracy, whereas simulation models require too many details, making them impractical. Aggregation is a way to overcome this difficulty. The various details are not modeled in detail, but their contribution is lumped in the aggregate model, which makes the model more appropriate for both analysis and simulation. This paper gives an overview of our efforts to develop a top-down aggregate modeling approach for semiconductor equipment, starting from the effective process time concept inspired by the Factory Physics book of Hopp and Spearman. The strong feature of our modeling approach is that the aggregate model parameters are estimated directly from industrial data (arrival and departure times), without the need to quantify the various details.  2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) requires expensive diagnostic equipment and is labor intensive. To evaluate the effective use of the MRI resources a curve of flow time versus throughput may be helpful in quantifying the trade-off between patient waiting time and resource utilization, and in providing insight into operational time losses and variability. This curve may be obtained by simulation. However, building a detailed simulation model of an MRI department requires expertise typically unavailable in hospitals. To overcome this difficulty, we seek for an appropriate aggregate model of the MRI department, either a simulation or an analytical model. The aggregate model parameters are to be determined from hospital patient arrival and departure times. We study three different aggregate models for use in the MRI setting. To be able to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the candidate aggregate models we use a detailed simulation model as virtual MRI department.  2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Concepts for aggregate modeling and simulation are presented and applied for the setting of the parameters of a CONWIP flow control system within the steel products cell at Grand Rapids Chair, a high-mix, low-volume manufacturing environment. Aggregation was accomplished by combining the over 100 types of products into one. This resulted in a single arrival process, routing modeled as random movement through workstations, and a single operation time distribution for each production operation. Aggregation reduced the effort required for model development, data analysis, validation, and simulation. The CONWIP control was shown to be effective in managing the work-in-process. A CONWIP parameter of 50 resulted in an equivalent throughput to that achieved with no limit on work-in-process. Lead time can be reduced by approximately 20% by increasing the CONWIP parameter to 58.  2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

  abstract = {The semiconductor sector is undergoing one of the fastest market growths. Demand is increasing and market forecasts are optimistic. New markets are emerging and product portfolios are broadening significantly. Dynamic supply chains are developing with increasing number of customers, products, suppliers and manufacturing partnerships. Up to now due to modeling complexity and computation time constraints, disjoint systems are used for local supply chain control and optimization. For efficient control, these complex semiconductor supply chains require a global approach for simulation and optimization. This is the motivation for this conceptual paper. In the conceptual part this paper introduces and discusses novel model aggregation approaches and model validity improvements with novel hierarchical modeling concepts. In the modeling part this paper incorporates that into an aggregated simulation model approach as well as a novel hierarchical interface concept for coupling of disaggregated analytical and simulation models to systematically improve overall model validity at Bosch.  2018 IEEE},

  abstract = {In conceptual analysis of higher level manufacturing systems, for instance when the constraint on system level is sought, it may not be very practical to use detailed simulation models. Developing detailed models on supply chain level or plant wide level may be very time consuming and might also be computationally costly to execute, especially if optimization techniques are to be applied. Aggregation techniques, simplifying a detailed system into fewer objects, can be an effective method to reduce the required computational resources and to shorten the development time. An aggregated model can be used to identify the main system constraints, dimensioning inter-line buffers, and focus development activities on the critical issues from a system performance perspective. In this paper a novel line aggregation technique suitable for manufacturing systems optimization is proposed, analyzed and tested in order to establish a proof of concept while demonstrating the potential of the technique.  2015 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This paper formulates an overall line effectiveness (OLE) improvement scheme for a production line on the basis of Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST) and stochastic Kriging (SK) surrogate model. It is known that improving the key parameters that have great influence on the target performance can bring better effect on the performance than improving other parameters. Thus this paper is concentrated on improving the OLE of a production line through improving multiple key parameters related to the OLE. In the proposed procedure, FAST is used to identify the key parameters for the OLE and a SK surrogate model is built to evaluate the OLE of the production line instead of a simulation model, improving the work efficiency effectively. At last, a comparison with the continuous improvement process (CIP) shows that the scheme formulated with FAST and SK surrogate model is easier to be implemented than the one generated by CIP, because the procedure provided in this paper can give further suggestion to improve the OLE when the improvement of the bottleneck is limited.  2018 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Population-based algorithms, which require a large number of fitness evaluations, can become computationally intractable when applied in engineering design optimization problems involving computational expensive simulations. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an on-line variable-fidelity metamodel assisted Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (OLVFM-MOGA) approach. In OLVFM-MOGA, the variable-fidelity metamodel (VFM) is constructed to replace the expensive simulation models to ease the computational burden. Besides, a novel model updating strategy is developed to address the issues of 1) which sample points should be sent for simulation analysis to improve the optimization quality, and 2) whether the low-fidelity (LF) model or the high-fidelity (HF) model should be selected to run for a selected sample point. Six numerical examples and an engineering case with different degrees of complexity are used to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach. Results illustrate that the proposed OLVFM-MOGA is able to obtain comparable convergence and diversity of the Pareto frontier as to that obtained by MOGA with HF model, while at the same time significantly reducing the computational cost.  2018 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGAs) are effective ways for obtaining Pareto solutions of multi-objective design optimization problems. However, the high computational cost of MOGAs limits their applications to practical engineering optimization problems involving computational expensive simulations. To address this issue, a novel variable-fidelity (VF) optimization approach for multi-objective design optimization is proposed, in which a VF metamodel is embedded in the computation process of MOGA to replace the expensive simulation model. The VF metamodel is updated in the optimization process of MOGA, considering the cost of simulation models with different fidelity and the influence of the VF metamodel uncertainty. A normalized distance constraint is introduced to avoid selecting clustered sample points. Four numerical examples and two engineering cases are used to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach can obtain Pareto solutions with good quality and outperforms the other four approaches considered here as references in terms of computational efficiency.  2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Model abstraction is a method for reducing the complexity of a simulation model while maintaining the validity of the simulation results with respect to the question that the simulation is being used to address. Frantz1 identified and categorized a number of abstraction techniques drawn from both traditional simulation modeling and more recent approaches such as qualitative simulation and metamodeling. In this paper, we consider how to make practical use of the abstraction concept. We first look at some examples of abstractions to illustrate the concepts and applications of abstractions in the context of actual models. We then generalize these examples to discuss a methodology for using abstractions as the basis for model analysis and design.},

  abstract = {This project combines surrogate modeling, a supervised machine learning technique, to bypass whole building energy simulations to enable multi-objective design optimization. We applied this method to identify Pareto optimal retrofit designs that are energy and cost effective for three residential apartments in Lisbon, Portugal. As part of our validation of this approach, we compared the surrogate model error for these Pareto optimal designs to the error in the rest of the design space when compared to a detailed energy simulation. Surrogate model error is higher towards the minimum and maximum energy consumption within the Pareto optimal designs compared to the rest of the design space. We also find that in the Pareto optimal set some design variable values are near their minimum or maximum value, which could be driving higher surrogate model error. We propose that future research should retrain the surrogate model after identifying design variable values of interest from an initial optimization run.  2019 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

  abstract = {This paper examines in detail reasons for using constructively simple models in management science interventions. Constructive simplicity is an objective concept describing the form and level of detail in a model. It is distinguished from the subjective concept of transparency, which relates to user-comprehension of a model. Usual arguments for constructive simplicity focus on model-building considerations such as model clarity, flexibility and convenience. Constructively simple models are also an efficient way of learning about decision situations. Client managers may prefer constructive simplicity not only as a convenient way of ensuring transparent models, but also for reasons related to motivation, time constraints, implementation and involvement of third parties. A principal conclusion is that constructive simplicity in modelling is a robust strategy for effective interventions.  1989, Operational Research Society Ltd.},

  abstract = {We start with basic terminology and concepts of modeling, and decompose the art of modeling as a process. This overview of the process helps clarify when we should or should not use simulation models. We discuss some common missteps made by many inexperienced modelers, and propose a concrete approach for avoiding those mistakes. After a quick review of event graphs, which are a very straightforward notation for discrete event systems, we illustrate how an event graph can be translated quite directly to a computer program with the aid of a surprisingly simple library. The resulting programs are easy to implement and computationally are extremely efficient. The first half of the paper focuses principles of modeling, and should be of general interest. The second half will be of interest to students, teachers, and readers who wish to know how simulation models work and how to implement them from the ground up.  2006 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This article discusses simplification in the context of discrete event modelling and simulation. An attempt is made to automate simplification. To achieve this, the definition of homomorphism for discrete event models is weakened to be used as a formal basis. In this approach, in addition to the models themselves, the modeller specifies a set of functions which map the input, output and state sets of a model into their corresponding simplified images. Our method uses this information along with the histories of original models to identify simplified equivalents of the original models. The concepts are implemented in DEVS-Scheme, a general purpose theory-based event simulation environment. The approach uses observation data to generate lumped model code. For experimentations, the lumped model codes are substituted in place of their original models and simulations are conducted to compare the behaviors of lumped and original models. The results are reported. The article also contains a section on future directions of simplification research.  1990, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of supply chain or workshop management is often based on simulation. This simulation task needs models which are difficult to design. The aim of this work is to reduce the complexity of simulation model design and to partially automate this task by combining discrete and continuous approaches in order to construct more efficient and reduced model. Model design focuses on bottlenecks with a discrete approach according to the theory of constraints. The remaining of the workshop is modeled in a less precise way by using continuous model in order to describe only how the bottlenecks are fed. This used continuous model is a regression tree algorithm. For validation, this approach is applied to the modeling of a sawmill workshop and the results are compared with results obtained previously by using a neural network model.

  abstract = {The lack of a methodology, or at least detailed guidelines, for choosing the best model in a mathematical or computer modelling study stems from a poor understanding of the precise ways in which the success of the study depends upon the particular model used. As a result, the choice of the best model is regarded as more of an art than a science. In order to improve the model selection process, model performance needs to be clearly defined, and suitable model attributes identified that can be used to predict the performance of the alternative candidate models. This paper distinguishes the different aspects of model performance and considers the extent to which they can be measured. The most common attributes used to compare alternative models are level of detail and complexity although these terms are used in a number of different ways. The meanings of these concepts are therefore discuss and the likely relationships with the model performance elements considered. The related area of simplification is reviewed and the areas in which further work is required are set out.},

  abstract = {In spite of the wide improvements in computer simulation packages, many complex simulation models, particularly under uncertainty, may be inefficient to run in terms of time, computation, and resources. To address such a challenge, integrating metamodels and robust design optimization has been applied. In the current paper, a systematic comparative study is implemented to evaluate the performance of three common metamodels, namely polynomial regression, kriging, and radial basis function. The required experiments are designed by different space-filling methods including the orthogonal array design and three forms of Latin hypercube sampling such as randomized, maximin, and correlation approaches. Although, the impact of sample size on the performance of metamodels in robust optimization results are investigated. All methods are analyzed using five two-dimensional test problems and one engineering problem while all of them are considered in two forms that are expensive (with a small sample size) and semi-expensive (with a large sample size). Uncertainty is assumed in all problems as a source of variability, so all test problems are conducted in the format of robust optimization in the class of dual response surface in order to estimate robust Pareto frontier. The performances of methods are studied in two terms of accuracy and robustness. Finally, the results of comparison, an applicable guideline is provided to aid the practitioners in selecting the appropriate combination of metamodels and sampling design methods for investigating set of robust optimal points (estimated Pareto frontier) in simulationoptimization problems under uncertainty.

  abstract = {In this article, we introduce complexity measures for simulation models. The framework of simulation graphs sets the context. A quantifiable measure of complexity is useful in an a priori evaluation of proposed simulation studies that must be completed within a specified budget. They can also be useful in classifying simulation models to obtain a thorough test bed of models to be used in simulation methodology research. The metrics introduced in this article have a rigorous theoretical, as well as empirical, grounding in software engineering. As such, simulation modeling and analysis represent a new area of application. Some surrogate measures of run time complexity are also developed. In particular, we provide estimates for the size of the future events list (or the pending event set). The proposed metrics are illustrated and compared through a limited set of examples. Limitations of the current approach as well as directions for future research are discussed.  1998 INFORMS.},

  abstract = {Simulation modelling is the business of reducing complexity of the real world. Keep your models small and simple, is the basic heuristic found in simulation & modelling literature; yet the modellers are developing models of increasing size and complexity. Simulation model size and complexity is generally a less debated and poorly understood area. Despite the importance of model simplification and its relation with size and complexity; only a handful of papers, addressing the size and complexity of simulation models, can be found. This paper reports on general concepts of simulation model size and complexity held by expert modellers and proposes a framework to understand the origins of simulation model size and complexity. Size and complexity are two most important contextual factors that may affect simulation practice. Increased understanding of concepts of simulation model size and complexity held by the modellers will potentially underpin simulation methodology research and help us in addressing the issues raised by increasing size and complexity of simulation models.  2016, Vienna University of Technology.

  abstract = {It is generally recognized that conceptual modeling is one of the most vital parts of a simulation study. At the same time, it also seems to be one of the least understood. A review of the extant literature on conceptual modeling reveals a range of issues that need to be addressed: the definition of conceptual model(ling), conceptual model requirements, how to develop a conceptual model, conceptual model representation and communication, conceptual model validation, and teaching conceptual modeling. It is clear that this is an area ripe for further research, for the clarification of ideas and the development of new approaches. Some areas in which further research could be carried out are identified.  2006 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Conceptual modelling is probably the most important aspect of a simulation study. It is also the most difficult and least understood. Over 40 years of simulation research and practice have provided only limited information on how to go about designing a simulation conceptual model. This paper, the first of two, discusses the meaning of conceptual modelling and the requirements of a conceptual model. Founded on existing literature, a definition of a conceptual model is provided. Four requirements of a conceptual model are described: validity, credibility, utility and feasibility. The need to develop the simplest model possible is also discussed. Owing to a paucity of advice on how to design a conceptual model, the need for a conceptual modelling framework is proposed. Built on the foundations laid in this paper, a conceptual modelling framework is described in the paper that follows.  2008 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Following on from the definition of a conceptual model and its requirements laid out in a previous paper, a framework for conceptual modelling is described. The framework consists of five iterative activities: understanding the problem situation, determining the modelling and general project objectives, identifying the model outputs, identify the model inputs, and determining the model content. The framework is demonstrated with a modelling application at a Ford Motor Company engine assembly plant. The paper concludes with a discussion on identifying data requirements from the conceptual model and the assessment of the conceptual model.  2008 Operational Research Society Ltd.

  abstract = {Conceptual modelling has gained a lot of interest in recent years and simulation modellers are particularly interested in understanding the processes involved in arriving at a conceptual model. This paper contributes to this understanding by discussing the artifacts of conceptual modelling and two specific conceptual modelling processes: knowledge acquisition and model abstraction. Knowledge acquisition is the process of finding out about the problem situation and arriving at a system description. Model abstraction refers to the simplifications made in moving from a system description to a conceptual model. Soft Systems Methodology has tools that can help a modeller with knowledge acquisition and model abstraction. These tools are drawing rich pictures, undertaking analyses 'one', 'two', 'three', and constructing a root definition and the corresponding purposeful activity model.

A complexity metric suitable for model representations is described. A study of existing metrics provides a basis for the development of the desired metric, and a set of characteristics for a simulation model complexity metric is defined. A metric is described that is based on the two types of complexity that are apparent in model representations. Experimental data are presented to verify that this metric possesses the desired characteristics and appears to offer an improvement over existing metrics.},

  abstract = {In this paper a method for controlled simplification is presented, which is able to create simplified models with specific properties concerning complexity and behavioral deviation automatically. The method requires a finite set of model component classes, of which instances a user-defined model can be created. Two techniques for simplification are used: aggregation, where a large set of components is substituted by a small set, and omission, where components are deleted without compensation. A set of simplification rules concerning the simplification techniques, the component classes and the model structures line and parallel line are defined. These rules are used by a simplification algorithm, which is embedded in a control loop of complexity measurement and behavior measurement. 2009 IEEE.},

  abstract = {In simulations of complex physical phenomena, model reductions are often required to decrease the computation time of the simulation model to a feasible level. Model reduction is often obtained by using a reduced model, which may be based on a reduced numerical approximation and simplifications of the underlying accurate model. The use of a reduced model, however, induces errors to the simulation results. In this paper, we describe and evaluate a novel approach for the correction of the approximation errors in reduced simulation models. The key idea is to model the approximation error between the accurate and reduced simulation model as an additive noise term to the reduced model and construct a low-cost predictor model for the approximation error based on statistical learning. In this paper, the approximation error approach is evaluated with the following problems: correction of spatial and temporal discretization errors in a time-varying heat equation- based evolution model, correction of spatial discretization errors in a Navier-Stokes velocity field simulation model, and correction of errors due to the use of a simplified physical model in cloud droplet formation simulation. The low-cost predictor of the approximation error is constructed and compared using six different regressor models. In all test cases, the approximation error-corrected simulation improved significantly the accuracy of the reduced model and also outperformed the conventional approach where a statistical learning-based predictor is constructed directly for the accurate model. Further, the computation times of the approximation error-corrected models were significantly smaller than those of the corresponding accurate models.  2018 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

  abstract = {Supply chain management offers a large potential for organizations to reduce costs and improve customer service performance. Simulation of supply chains can help in these objectives by evaluating the impact of alternate inventory control policies. Supply chain simulation involves modeling of multiple factories across the chain and can get quite complex. Analysts typically carry out such simulation at a coarse level of detail to keep the complexity and computing resources manageable. However, modeling at coarse levels may reduce the accuracy of outputs and affect the quality of decisions. In this paper, we report on a study to compare the quality of results at different levels of details in a semiconductor supply chain simulation.},

  abstract = {The use of high fidelity simulations is becoming more common in computer-aided design and optimization. Due to the complexity of the simulation models and the lack of closed-form mathematical formulations, the direct use of traditional deterministic optimization tools is prohibitive for such problems. Therefore, data-driven decision-making has become increasingly important, with surrogate-based optimization being one of the most popular approaches. Two of the most important challenges in surrogate-based optimization are the lack of consistent convergence metrics, and the variability in the quality of the incumbent solution when a different sampling set or a different surrogate model is used to guide the search. In this work, we propose a strategy to mitigate this uncertainty in the performance of such algorithms. A novel data-driven spatial branch-and-bound framework is proposed that uses stochastic bounds on different surrogate models and partitioning of the search space. The convergence properties of this algorithm are studied through a large set of benchmark problems.},

  abstract = {This contribution summarizes the design and analysis of experiments with computerized simulation models. It focuses on two metamodel (surrogate, emulator) types, namely first-order or second-order polynomial regression, and Kriging (or Gaussian process). The metamodel type determines the design of the simulation experiment, which determines the input combinations of the simulation model. Before applying these metamodels, the analysts should screen the many inputs of a realistic simulation model; this contribution focuses on sequential bifurcation. Optimization of the simulated system may use either a sequence of first-order and second-order polynomialsso-called response surface methodology (RSM)or Kriging models fitted through sequential designsincluding efficient global optimization (EGO). Robust optimization accounts for uncertainty in some simulation inputs.  Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

The author reports on the effects of the commonly made assumptions of no rework, representing rework by increasing process times, no operator constraints, and no machine failures. The author uses a detailed, flexible model in which the assumptions may or may not be made. The base case, validated for a real line, makes none of the simplifying assumptions listed and is compared with subsequent runs making each assumption in turn. Generally, performance is degraded. In some cases the performance measures (resources utilization, work-in-process, and cycle times) remain within 20% of the base case.},

Choosing which method to use is not a simple task, but very important because it affects the complexity and ultimately the costs associated with the model's development and the model's expected uses. The methodology is presented by means of a case study where it was used in the development of a timber harvesting simulation model. The methodology is primarily based upon analysis of variance and demonstrates one way which has been used in choosing between varying levels of complexity in generating random samples within a simulation model using as a criterion the validity of the alternate methods' results.  1984.},

  abstract = {Discrete event simulation is an important system analysis technique. But for today's demand for speed, the time to complete a simulation study is considered to be long, even with current developments in hardware and simulation software. In this scenario, simplification methods for simulation models could play a key role. This paper proposes a technique for reducing the complexity of a discrete event simulation model at the conceptual phase of simulation modeling that can be fully automatized through a computer program. We applied this technique on some problems which demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.  2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Discrete-event simulation is a well-established and rather successful method in some semiconductor companies, while other companies do not use simulation at all. Simulation is used for performance assessment and decision-making. This paper focuses on the methodological and practical issues that have to be addressed to build, use, and maintain simulation models for a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility (wafer fab). We describe and discuss the main steps of a simulation study in this domain. We seek to highlight the main issues and present alternative ways to address them. Common pitfalls in using discrete-event simulation in semiconductor manufacturing and how they can be avoided are also discussed.  2015 International journal of industrial engineering.},

  abstract = {Discrete-event simulation is a well-accepted method for planning, evaluating, and monitoring processes in production and logistics. To reduce time and effort spent on creating simulation models, automatic simulation model generation is an important area in modeling methodology research. When automatically generating a simulation model from existing data sources, the correct reproduction of dynamic behavior of the modeled system is a common challenge. One example is the representation of dispatching and scheduling strategies of production jobs. When generating a model automatically, the underlying rules for these strategies are typically unknown but yet have to be adequately emulated. In this paper, we summarize our work investigating the suitability of various data mining and supervised machine learning methods for emulating job scheduling decisions based on data obtained from production data acquisition. We report on the performance of the algorithms and give recommendations for their application, including suggestions for their integration in simulation systems.  2016 The Operational Research Society.},

  abstract = {Stochastic kriging is a popular metamodeling technique to approximate computationally expensive simulation models. However, it typically treats the simulation model as a black box in practice and often fails to capture the highly nonlinear response surfaces that arise from queueing simulations. We propose a simple, effective approach to improve the performance of stochastic kriging by incorporating stylized queueing models that contain useful information about the shape of the response surface. We provide several statistical tools to measure the usefulness of the incorporated stylized models. We show that even a relatively crude stylized model can substantially improve the prediction accuracy of stochastic kriging.  2018, Copyright  2018 IISE.},

  abstract = {In this panel discussion five leading simulation practitioners discuss a number of critical issues facing a person who is trying to use simulation to design a new system or to improve the performance of an existing system. John Carson, Kenneth Musselman, and Onur Ulgen are consultants, while Jerry Fox/Stephen Halladin are major users of simulation at a company that very extensively employs this technology. The questions discussed in this article were chosen by the discussants and myself based on our collective years of simulation modeling experience as being both important and of general interest. One of the questions - how to determine the level of model detail - is, perhaps, the single most difficult methodological issue confronting an analyst trying to model a large, complex system. If there is not enough detail in the model, then it will probably be invalid and produce erroneous results. On the other hand, an overly detailed model may result in missed deadlines and in excessive computer execution time or memory requirements. Two additional questions address the ingredients for overall project success and how to collect good information/data on the system of interest. Finally, the discussants give their views on where the field of simulation modeling is headed in the next three years. This discussion is based in part on a similar paper by Law (1993).},

The KIDS approach entails one starts with the simulation model that relates to the target phenomena in the most straightforward way possible, taking into account the widest possible range of evidence, including anecdotal accounts and expert opinion. Simplification is only applied if and when the model and evidence justify this. This contrasts sharply with the KISS approach where one starts with the simplest possible model and only moves to a more complex one if forced to.

  abstract = {This paper introduces performance-informed design space exploration (DSE) to question the relationship between explicit, quantitative optimization problems and wicked, co-evolving architectural design problems and to support the reframing of architectural design optimization as a medium for reflection. The paper proposes selection, refinement, and understanding as key aspects of performance-informed DSE and surveys current approaches to performance-informed DSE: (1) Clustering and Pareto-based optimization support selection by reducing large numbers of parametric design candidates into smaller and more meaningful sets of choices. (2) Surrogate modelling supports refinement by approximating time-intensive simulations in real-time, which is important for interactivity. (3) Multi-variate visualizations and statistical analyses support understanding by providing insights into characteristics of design spaces and fitness landscapes. Finally, the paper discusses a novel tool for visual and interactive, performance-informed DSE, Performance Explorer. Performance Explorer combines the real-time feedback afforded by surrogate models with a multi-variate visualization of fitness landscapes. A user test of Performance Explorer uncovered several performanceinformed DSE strategies followed by the participants. Consisting of different combinations of selection, refinement, and understanding, these strategies illustrate andto some extentvalidate the proposed framework for performance-informed DSE.  2019 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

  abstract = {Even though we have moved beyond the Industrial Age and into the Information Age, manufacturing remains an important part of the global economy. There is a need for the pervasive use of modeling and simulation for decision support in current and future manufacturing systems, and several challenges need to be addressed by the simulation community to realize this vision. First, an order of magnitude reduction in problem-solving cycles is needed. The second grand challenge is the development of real-time, simulation-based problem-solving capability. The third grand challenge is the need for true plug-and-play interoperability of simulations and supporting software. Finally, there is the biggest challenge facing modeling and simulation analysts today: that of convincing management to sponsor modeling and simulation projects instead of, or in addition to, more commonly used manufacturing system design and improvement methods such as lean manufacturing and six sigma.  2004 The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.},

  abstract = {The graph transformation based method presented in this paper can automatically generate simulation models assuming that the models are intended for a certain domain. The method differs from other methods in that: the data used for model generation does not contain specifications of the model structures to be generated; the generated simulation models have structures that are dynamically constructed during the model generation process. Existing data typically has quality issues and does not contain all types of information, particularly in terms of model structure, that are required for modelling. To solve the problem, transformation rules are designed to infer the required model selection and structure information from the data. The rules are specified on meta-models of the original data structure, of intermediate structures and of the simulation model. Graph patterns, pattern composites and graph pattern matching algorithms are used to define and identify potential model components. Model composite structures are represented by hypergraphs according to which simulation models are generated using model components as building blocks. The method has been applied practically in the domain of light-rail transport.  2016 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This article discusses a number of common interpretations of 'implementation' in the literature, and how these have been confused. Various different levels of implementation are then discussed, including the concept of model effectiveness. This is concerned with both the operational effectiveness of the model, as shown by a tangible improvement in the system modelled, and the personal effectiveness in helping users learn more about the system itself. Research is then described to explore various aspects of model usage and effectiveness. The research took place in the context of a business game used by a large number of practising managers. An unusual feature of the game was the fact that participants were offered the use of a number of models to aid their decisions. The usage of the models, and their effects, were measured objectively. Results showed that models were used extensively, and their effects were advantageous in a number of ways. The implications of this work are discussed.  1985.},

  abstract = {Semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities (wafer fabs) are among the most complex production facilities. A large product variety, hundreds of processing steps per product, hundreds of machines of different types, and automated transport lead to a system complexity which is hard to understand and hard to handle. For educating planners and developing adequate material flow control mechanisms, simple models for this complex environment are required. Several years ago, we published some first approaches which were useful to explain the fab behavior after a serious bottleneck breakdown. With that simple model, however, it was only possible to predict the cycle time distribution of the lots for a few scenarios. In this paper, we present some model improvements which lead to a rather good cycle time prediction for a variety of load situations.  2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Metamodels can be used to reduce the computational burden associated with computationally demanding analyses of simulation models, although applications within health economics are still scarce. Besides a lack of awareness of their potential within health economics, the absence of guidance on the conceivably complex and time-consuming process of developing and validating metamodels may contribute to their limited uptake. To address these issues, this article introduces metamodeling to the wider health economic audience and presents a process for applying metamodeling in this context, including suitable methods and directions for their selection and use. General (i.e., non-health economic specific) metamodeling literature, clinical prediction modeling literature, and a previously published literature review were exploited to consolidate a process and to identify candidate metamodeling methods. Methods were considered applicable to health economics if they are able to account for mixed (i.e., continuous and discrete) input parameters and continuous outcomes. Six steps were identified as relevant for applying metamodeling methods within health economics: 1) the identification of a suitable metamodeling technique, 2) simulation of data sets according to a design of experiments, 3) fitting of the metamodel, 4) assessment of metamodel performance, 5) conducting the required analysis using the metamodel, and 6) verification of the results. Different methods are discussed to support each step, including their characteristics, directions for use, key references, and relevant R and Python packages. To address challenges regarding metamodeling methods selection, a first guide was developed toward using metamodels to reduce the computational burden of analyses of health economic models. This guidance may increase applications of metamodeling in health economics, enabling increased use of state-of-the-art analyses (e.g., value of information analysis) with computationally burdensome simulation models.},

The six principles discussed here cover simplicity versus complexity; model development as a gradual, almost piecemeal process; dividing larger models into smaller components; using analogies; proper uses of data; and finally the way in which the modeling process can seem chaotic. Others may wish to comment on these principles and add their own.},

  abstract = {As the costs of building a new wafer fab increase, a detailed simulation model representing the production operations, the tools, the automated material handling systems (AMHS), and the tool-AMHS interactions is needed for accurately planning the capacity of these facilities. The problem is that it currently takes too long to build, experiment, and analyze a sufficiently detailed model of a fab. The key for building accurate and computationally efficient fab models is to decide on the right amount of model details, specifically those details representing the equipment capacity and the AMHS. This paper identifies a method for classifying a fab model by the level of capacity detail, the level of AMHS detail, or the level of capacity/AMHS detail. Within the capacity/AMHS modeling level, our method further differentiates between detailed integrated capacity/AMHS models and abstract coupled capacity/AMHS models. The proposed classification method serves as the basis of a framework that helps users select the system components to be modeled within a desired level of detail. This research also provides a review of past-published literature summarizing the work done at each of the proposed fab modeling levels. A case study comparing the performance between an integrated capacity/AMHS model and a coupled capacity/AMHS model is presented. The study demonstrates that the coupled model generates cycle time estimates that are not statistically different than those generated by the integrated model. This paper also shows that the coupled model can improve CPU time by approximately 98% in relation to the integrated model.  2008 IEEE.},

  abstract = {In many situations, simulation models are developed to handle complex real-world business optimisation problems. In our case, a discrete-event simulation model is used to simulate trailer management and fleet configuration in a big Fast-Moving Consumer Goods company. To address the problem of finding suitable simulation inputs for optimisation, we propose a simulation optimisation approach. The simulation optimisation model combines metaheuristic search (genetic algorithm), with an approximation model filter (feed-forward neural network) to optimise the input configuration of the simulation model. In this work, we introduce an ensure probability that overrules the rejection of potential solutions by the approximation model and demonstrate its effectiveness. In addition, we evaluate the impact of the genetic algorithm parameters and show how population size, filter threshold, and mutation probability impact overall fleet optimisation performance. Lastly, we compare the proposed method with a single global approximation model and a random-based approach, our results demonstrate the advantage of our method in terms of computational time and solution quality.},

  abstract = {In simulation-based realization of complex systems, we are forced to address the issue of computational complexity. One critical issue that must be addressed is the approximation of reality using surrogate models to replace expensive simulation models of engineering problems. In this paper, we critically review over 200 papers. We find that a framework for selecting appropriate surrogate modeling methods for a given function with specific requirements has been lacking. Having such a framework for surrogate model users, specifically practitioners in industry, is very important because there is very limited information about the performance of different models before applying them on the problem. Our contribution in this paper is to address this gap by creating practical guidance based on a trade-off among three main drivers, namely, size (how much information is necessary to compute the surrogate model), accuracy (how accurate the surrogate model must be) and computational time (how much time is required for the surrogate modeling process). Using the proposed guidance a huge amount of time is saved by avoiding time-consuming comparisons before selecting the appropriate surrogate model. To make this contribution, we review the state-of-the-art surrogate modeling literature to answer the following three questions: (1) What are the main classes of the design of experiment (DOE) methods, surrogate modeling methods and model-fitting methods based on the requirements of size, computational time, and accuracy? (2) Which surrogate modeling method is suitable based on the critical characteristics of the requirements of size, computational time and accuracy? (3) Which DOE is suitable based on the critical characteristics of the requirements of size, computational time and accuracy? Based on these three characteristics, we find six different qualitative categories for the surrogate models through a critical evaluation of the literature. These categories provide a framework for selecting an efficient surrogate modeling process to assist those who wish to select more appropriate surrogate modeling techniques for a given function. It is also summarized in Table 4 and Figs.2, 3. MARS, response surface models, and kriging are more appropriate for large problems, acquiring less computation time and high accuracy, respectively. Also, Latin Hypercube, fractional factorial designs and D-Optimal designs are appropriate experimental designs. Our contribution is to propose a qualitative evaluation and a mental model which is based on quantitative results and findings of authors in the published literature. The value of such a framework is in providing practical guide for researchers and practitioners in industry to choose the most appropriate surrogate model based on incomplete information about an engineering design problem. Another contribution is to use three drivers, namely, computational time, accuracy, and problem size instead of using a single measure that authors generally use in the published literature.  2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Simplicity and validity are recognized as important attributes of an effective simulation model. However, some disagreement exists both on the definitions of these concepts and on quantitative measures for them. This paper introduces Enrichment Level (EL) for (simulation) models. The EL is a quantitative measure to compare the effectiveness of alternative models when used in a particular project. While there is no conceptual restriction on expanding the EL, it currently captures the bias, speed, variance, and scope of a model as the main contributing enrichment factors. This paper explores these factors and suggests a utility-based method to combine them according to the relative importance of each enrichment factor. Model effectiveness measures currently used in academic and industrial studies are discussed and compared to the proposed EL. In order to show the usability of EL as a model comparison tool, we study an example of a queue with multi-failure mode servers and apply our method to facilitate decisions about choosing the most suitable model among a set of three.  2012 Operational Research Society Ltd.},

  abstract = {In many engineering design contexts models are indispensable. They offer decision support and help tackle complex and interconnected design projects, capturing the underlying structure of development processes or resulting products. Because managers and engineers base many decisions on models, it is crucial to understand their properties and how these might influence their behaviour. The level of detail, or granularity, of a model is a key attribute that results from how reality is abstracted in the modelling process. Despite the direct impact granularity has on the use of a model, the general topic has so far only received limited attention and is therefore not well understood or documented. This article provides background on model theory, explores relevant terminology from a range of fields and discusses the implications for engineering design. Based on this, a classification framework is synthesised, which outlines the main manifestations of model granularity. This research contributes to theory by scrutinising the nature of model granularity. It also illustrates how this may manifest in engineering design models, using Design Structure Matrices as an example, and discusses associated challenges to provide a resource for modellers navigating decisions regarding granularity.

  abstract = {Simulation model is extensively used for evaluation of dispatching rules in semiconductor wafer fabrication. However, due to the high complexity of the simulation model, the simulation is so time-consuming that it cannot response to the dynamic changes of practical fabrication well. In order to reduce computer execution time and in the same time maintain the ability of the model to evaluate the scheduling rules correctly, a model reduction method based on selective clustering ensemble algorithm (SCEA) and Theory of Constraints (TOC) is proposed. Firstly, SCEA is adopted to identify the unimportant machines steadily, in which multiple base clusterings (BCs) are trained by k-means with different initial cluster centers and then are combined into a final result based on selective weight-voting strategy. Secondly, unimportant machines are removed from the detailed model, since such machines may not significantly affect the performance of the system, according to TOC. Thirdly, closed-loop correction structure is built to ensure the robustness of the reduced model. Finally, the reduced simulation model is used to evaluate the dispatching rules respectively with the scheduling objective of on-time delivery (OTD) rate, mean cycle time (MCT) and throughput. The simulation results show that the method presented is available and effective.  2016 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Simulation is becoming a popular tool, aided by the development of powerful and faster computers, new features like parallel and distributed simulation and easier simulation software that allows to reduce the time to implement a model. In spite of that, the cycle time of a simulation study is still long. This paper presents some remarks on Model Reduction Reasoning and how through this, the time of a simulation study could be reduced. The discussion is based on the example of Kienbaum and Paul (1994) of the Pub Problem, using a simplification of their H-ACD representation to describe the original and reduced models. The models are implemented and the results obtained shows their statistical equivalence which suggests the feasibility of this approach.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the possibility of model simplification in the context of ecological models. The techniques of simplification have arisen in a variety of disciplines and have received only limited attention in ecological studies. We applied some of these techniques in three instances and report our results in this paper. All of our simplification exercises were successful in the sense of making the models under scrutiny less complex. We present our results here as a demonstration of some of these simplification techniques and to generalize about the applicability of simplification to ecological models.  1985.},

  abstract = {Dispatching rules are widely used for scheduling of wafer fabrication facilities, and simulation is a popular tool for evaluation of rules. A main weakness of simulation is the long computation time. In this paper, we aim at simplifying the models of fabrication facilities to reduce simulation time and meanwhile keep the ability of evaluating rules correctly. We propose a metric to assess how well a simplified model evaluates rules and formulate the model simplification problem as a multiobjective optimization problem. We also develop an evolutionary algorithm to solve the formulated problem. Experimental results show that simplified models generated by the proposed algorithm can save half of simulation time and select high-performance rules.  2010 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Simulation models are meant to support industrial engineers in understanding complex problems and provide useful insights facilitating their solution. Models achieve this by reducing focus to system elements that matter. Surprisingly, despite its relevance, simulation model simplification is still very much a green field. This is mirrored in existing literature and course materials. In this article we seek to foster development of the field by proposing a framework for simulation model simplification addressing the manufacturing domain, thereby building on an extensive literature review. The framework structures the field by providing a unifying view on simulation model simplification, in terms of its key activities, i.e., reducing and preventing model complexity, and support offered in performing these. Apart from its role as a focal point for future research, the framework is meant to benefit practitioners and educators, by giving them access to research findings, and enabling and legitimatizing development of educational materials and their uptake.  2018 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Fab-level discrete-event simulation is an important practical tool for the analysis and optimization of semiconductor wafer fabricators. In such facilities, a clustered photolithography tool (CPT) is by far the most expensive tool and often the capacity bottleneck. In this paper, we consider linear, affine, flow line, and detailed models of CPTs for use in fab-level simulation. We develop extensions to affine and flow line models and demonstrate exactly how to convert raw CPT data into the various models. Using a detailed CPT model based on industry data as the baseline, numerical experiments are conducted to test the models' fidelity for cycle time, lot residency time, and throughput. We also compare the computational burden of each model class. Further simulations are conducted to test the models' robustness to changing fab conditions, e.g., when lot size or train size changes. Flow line models are shown to be more accurate and robust than linear or affine models and require approximately 200 times less computation than detailed models.  1988-2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The study is devoted to the development and research of new models and methods for the analysis and synthesis of the management of modern integrated facilities - production, retail, recycling, which are in active stochastic environment of suppliers, competitors, consumers. The analysis of analogues and prototypes revealed factors that guarantee the failure of new research and developments: - based only on Gaussian statistics, simplified models of object dynamics, search methods of large systems optimization. The classification of sources and generating mechanisms of the disturbances is carried out, models of nonlinear transformations of stochastic processes are presented. The paper presents the formulation and solution of problems of analyzing the influence of uncertainties and disturbances based on: - building of the resource simulation models of objects - virtual reality statistics generators; - using the optimal aggregation methodology to calculate the optimal operational and strategic management in the simulation model. The problems of obtaining probability distributions for non-linear transformations, in particular for the cost, output functions, are set and solved. Examples of the analysis of hyperbolic rank distributions and multimodal income probability distributions for the producer systems of a certain production segment are given. The development results made it possible to substantiate the conclusion about essentially non-Gaussian statistics of modern production systems and the recommendation about the need to study the statistics of optimal adaptive developing systems.  2020 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a two-stage multi-fidelity simulation optimization framework, containing a low-and high-fidelity process, to address a stochastic objective problem with several stochastic constraints and a huge discrete solution space. The population-based optimization algorithm assisted by the surrogate model is used as a low-fidelity process to reduce the solution space and generate the elite population. Subsequently, we exploit simulation model combined with the optimal computing budget allocation method, as a high-fidelity process, to find the best solution in the elite population. The proposed framework is tested on an optimization problem of medical staff configuration at emergency department in Hong Kong, which is formulated as optimizing the service requirement of urgent patients while satisfying the other service requirements and cost constraint. The experimental results demonstrated that, with a limited labor cost, there is a 52.35% average reduction in the waiting time of urgent patients and a 99.7% reduction in computational time.  2019, Computers and Industrial Engineering.

  abstract = {In the manufacturing industry, target-oriented and efficient use of resources is gaining importance, alongside economic optimization. The economic and organizational optimization of manufacturing systems according to the lean principles is only partly compatible with the goals of resource-efficient manufacturing. Therefore, an approach is sought to improve individual analyses of manufacturing systems. This paper proposes an approach for the multi-objective optimization of lean and resource-efficient manufacturing systems. To predict the dynamic effects of several configurations of manufacturing systems, material, energy, and information flows of a discrete event simulation are coupled with an assessment model, based on objectives of lean and resource-efficient manufacturing. Using design of experiments, Gaussian process meta-models are computed for the behavior of the simulation model. These meta-models allow the approximation of the system behavior to be computed in a short period of time and enable extensive multi-objective optimization and more adequate decision-making support systems. The proposed approach is tested in the metalworking industry.  2020, German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP).},

  abstract = {The article addresses an approximate solution to the multi-objective optimization problem for a black-box function of a manufacturing system. We employ the surrogate of the discrete-event simulation model of a batch production system in an analytical form. Integration of simulation, Design of Experiments methods, and Weighted Sum and Weighted Product multi-objective methods are used in an arrangement of a priori defined preferences to find a solution near the Pareto optimal solution in a criterion space. We compare the results obtained through the analytical approach to the outcomes of simulation-based optimization. The observed results indicate a possibility to apply the suitable analytical model for quickly finding the acceptable approximate solution close to the Pareto optimal front.  2020, MDPI AG.

  abstract = {For multiclass flow line models, we identify a class of service times that allow a decomposition of the system into subsets of servers called channels. In each channel, the customer delay is well structured and we develop a recursion to calculate it. The recursions provide an alternative to the elementary evolution equations. By considering batch arrivals and restricting the structure of the model, the recursions can require nearly one order of magnitude less computation than is otherwise possible. Flow lines can be used as models for semiconductor manufacturing equipment such as multicluster or clustered photolithography tools. The models allow for internal wafer buffers and setups that are wafer location dependent. The models have shown to be very accurate in tests with data from clustered photolithography tools in production. As such, the models may serve as good candidates to improve the fidelity of existing equipment models in fablevel simulation. 2010 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Simulation is often used to evaluate supply chain or workshop management. This simulation task needs models, which are difficult to construct. The aim of this work is to reduce the complexity of a simulation model design. The proposed approach combines discrete and continuous approaches in order to construct speeder and simpler reduced model. The simulation model focuses on bottlenecks with a discrete approach according to the theory of constraints. The remaining of the workshop must be taken into account in order to describe how the bottlenecks are fed. It is modeled through a continuous approach thanks to a neural network. In particular, we use a multilayer perceptron. The structure of the network is determined by using a pruning procedure. For validation, this approach is applied to the modelisation of a sawmill workshop.  2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Nowadays the size and complexity of models is growing more and more, forcing modelers to face some problems that they were not accustomed to. Before trying to study ways to deal with complex models, a more important and primary question to explore is, is there any means to avoid the generation of complex models? The primary purpose of this paper is to discuss several issues regarding the complexity of simulation models, summarizing the findings in this area so far, and calling attention to this area that, despite its importance, appears to remain at the bottom of simulation research agendas.},

  abstract = {This paper uses computational complexity theory to assess the difficulty of various discrete event simulation problems. More specifically, accessibility of states, ordering of events, noninterchangeability, of model implementations, and execution stalling for discrete event simulations are formally stated as search problems and proven to be NP-hard. The consequences of these results cover a wide range of modeling and analysis problems in simulation. For example, problems associated with certain variance reduction techniques, model verification, model validation, and the applicability of infinitesimal perturbation analysis, among others, are deemed intractable.},

  abstract = {Reacting quickly to changing market demands and new variants by improving and adapting industrial systems is an important business advantage. Changes to systems are costly; especially when those systems are already in place. Resources invested should be targeted so that the results of the improvements are maximized. One method allowing this is the combination of discrete event simulation, aggregated models, multi-objective optimization, and data-mining shown in this article. A real-world optimization case study of an industrial problem is conducted resulting in lowering the storage levels, reducing lead time, and lowering batch sizes, showing the potential of optimizing on the factory level. Furthermore, a base for decision-support is presented, generating clusters from the optimization results. These clusters are then used as targets for a decision tree algorithm, creating rules for reaching different solutions for a decision-maker to choose from. Thereby allowing decisions to be driven by data, and not by intuition.  2019, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Most management problems addressed by simulation studies can be characterized as complex and difficult to analyze. Simplification is instrumental in creating and employing simulation models that are useful - by focusing on those system elements that matter, and feasible - by reducing study efforts. Although simplification is considered a fundamental modelling activity, simulation educational support for mastering associated modelling skills is limited. Main textbooks either do not address this topic or tend to restrict their guidance to a few rules of thumb. This reflects how the topic of simulation model simplification is underdeveloped, despite the field of simulation being around 50 years of age. The purpose of this panel is to initiate a discussion about the way we teach simulation model simplification with the view to identifying improvements. This paper addresses the motivation for the panel, and presents panelists' positions about the way forward for education on simulation model simplification.  2018 IEEE},

  abstract = {Given the non-repeatability, complexity, and unpredictability of unconventional public health emergencies, building accurate models and making effective response decisions based only on traditional prediction-response decision-making methods are difficult. To solve this problem, under the scenario-response paradigm and theories on parallel emergency management and discrete event system (DES), the parallel simulation decision-making framework (PSDF), which includes the methods of abstract modeling, simulation operation, decision-making optimization, and parallel control, is proposed for unconventional public health emergency response processes. Furthermore, with the example of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) response process, the evolutionary scenarios that include infected patients and diagnostic processes are transformed into simulation processes. Then, the validity and operability of the DES-PSDF method proposed in this paper are verified by the results of a simulation experiment. The results demonstrated that, in the case of insufficient prior knowledge, effective parallel simulation models can be constructed and improved dynamically by multi-stage parallel controlling. Public health system bottlenecks and relevant effective response solutions can also be obtained by iterative simulation and optimizing decisions. To meet the urgent requirements of emergency response, the DES-PSDF method introduces a new response decision-making concept for unconventional public health emergencies.},

  abstract = {Metamodelling or surrogate modelling techniques are frequently used across the engineering disciplines in conjunction with expensive simulation models or physical experiments. With the proliferation of metamodeling techniques developed to provide enhanced performance for specific problems, and the wide availability of a diverse choice of tools in engineering software packages, the engineering task of selecting a robust metamodeling technique for practical problems is still a challenge. This research introduces a framework for describing the typology of engineering problems, in terms of dimensionality and complexity, and the modelling conditions, reflecting the noisiness of the signals and the affordability of sample sizes, and on this basis presents a systematic evaluation of the performance of frequently used metamodeling techniques. A set of metamodeling techniques, selected based on their reported use for engineering problems (i.e. Polynomial, Radial Basis Function, and Kriging), were systematically evaluated in terms of accuracy and robustness against a carefully assembled set of 18 test functions covering different types of problems, sampling conditions and noise conditions. A set of four real-world engineering case studies covering both computer simulation and physical experiments were also analysed as validation tests for the proposed guidelines. The main conclusions drawn from the study are that Kriging model with Matrn 5/2 correlation function performs consistently well across different problem types with smooth (i.e. not noisy) data, while Kriging model with Matrn 3/2 correlation function provides robust performance under noisy conditions, except for the very high noise conditions, where the Kriging model with nugget appears to provide better models. These results provide engineering practitioners with a guide for the choice of a metamodeling technique for problem types and modelling conditions represented in the study, whereas the evaluation framework and benchmarking problems set will be useful for researchers conducting similar studies.  2019, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {To predict cycle time distributions of integrated processing workstations, detailed simulation models are almost exclusively used; these models require considerable development and maintenance effort. As an alternative, we propose an aggregate model that is a lumped-parameter representation of the workstation. The aggregate model is a single server with a work-in-process dependent aggregate process time distribution and overtaking distribution. The lumped parameters are determined directly from arrival and departure events measured at the workstation. An extensive simulation study and an industry case demonstrate that the aggregate model can accurately predict the cycle time distribution of integrated processing workstations in semiconductor manufacturing.  2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the use of discrete event simulation (DES) for decision making in real time based on the potential for data streamed from production line sensors. Technological innovations for data collection and an increasingly competitive global market have led to an increase in the application of discrete event simulation by manufacturing companies in recent years. Scenario analysis and optimisation methods are often applied to these simulation models to improve objectives such as cost, profit and throughput. The literature review has identified key research gaps as the lack of example cases where multi-objective optimisation methods have been applied to simulation models and the need for a framework to visualise the relationship between inputs and outputs of simulation models. A framework is presented to enable the optimisation DES simulation models and optimise multiple objectives simultaneously using design of experiments and meta-models to create a Pareto front of solutions. The results show that the resource allocation meta-model provides acceptable prediction accuracy whilst the lead time meta-model was not able to provide accurate prediction. Regression trees have been proposed to assist stakeholders with understanding the relationships between input and output variables. The framework uses regression and classification trees with overlaid values for multiple objectives and random forests to improve prediction accuracy for new points. A real-life test case involving a turbine assembly process is presented to illustrate the use and validity of the framework. The generated regression tree expressed a general trend by demonstrating relationships between input variables and two conflicting objectives. Random forests were implemented for creating higher accuracy predictions and they produced a mean square error of ~ 0.066 on the training data and ~ 0.081 on test data.  2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Even today, medium-term production scheduling tends to be unsatisfactory in many industrial enterprises because it is usually based on escapist assumptions of fixed lead times and a mere summarising of the capacity supply and demand. These assumptions and the simplicity of the methods applied do not match the complexity of the scheduling problems to be solved. Thus the goals of the scheduling frequently fail to be achieved. Help might be at hand from simulation-based optimisation. Such optimisation, however, causes high computational costs, which will stand in the way of its practical application. This article reports a method of creating reduced simulation models of discrete production processes. The use of such reduced models instead of detailed ones lessens the computational costs considerably and hence makes the application of simulation-based optimisation for medium-term production scheduling possible. The reduction method was subjected to empirical investigation, the results of which are also presented here.},

  abstract = {Accurate and simple simulation flow model is useful to make decision at the right time to manage supply chain or workshop. To do that, different reduction model complexity approaches have been proposed. One of them is to associate discrete event model of bottlenecks and continuous model of other work centers according to the theory of constraints. The continuous approximation is used only do determine how the bottlenecks are fed. Different continuous model have been proposed in the past. This paper focuses on the association of regression trees and neural networks in order to benefit of the advantages of each other. This approach is used for the modeling of a sawmill workshop and the results are compared with those obtained previously by using only CART model or neural network model.  2015 International Institute for Innovation, Industrial Engineering and Entrepreneurship - I4e2.},

  abstract = {We present a dynamic model approximation strategy that allows to significantly increase computational efficiency of the simulation while maintaining proper validity. This can be used to effectively overcome the scalability constraints in state-of-the-art simulation frameworks for testing and validating large-scale systems. The method that we present leverages information theory metrics to measure the possible contribution of sub-areas in the simulation to the global behavior. This allows us to opportunistically approximate low-contributing areas and as a result decrease the computational cost of the simulation. We present a basic traffic-simulation use-case, implemented in the Acsim simulator to validate the proposed method and are able to achieve a 33% reduction of the computational cost. Furthermore, we analyze our proposed method from a more theoretical perspective. 2019 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

  abstract = {Usually simulation studies of automated material handling systems of semiconductor fabs are extremely time consuming. This is due to the high detail of models used for investigations which are partly provided by transportation system suppliers. These models only provide poor possibilities for adjustment and are computationally expensive. The article will address these issues by proposing an adjustable supplier-independent base simulation model. It allows easy building, adjusting, and running simulation models of path-based systems without deeper programming knowledge. A use case of Infineon's Dresden fab revealed simulation results with an accuracy in the same range as the supplier models while disregarding a few details and thus showing significant time savings in modeling and adjusting the system as well as running simulation studies. This can be done by choosing an appropriate level of abstraction.  2015 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Within the framework of the application of their industrial management system, companies compile a Master Production Schedule (MPS). However, once the MPS is released, daily events may require it to be brought into question. The use of reduced models within the framework of flow dynamic simulation enables quick decision-making while maximizing the use of resources and minimizing risk. The article shows the advantage of model reduction and how we arrive at it. Afterwards we develop an analysis of the influence of the model factors by highlighting the differences between the simulation results and MPS. Finally we show the circumstances in which the flow dynamic simulation with reduced models is relevant.  2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Although redundancy in model specification generally has negative connotations, we offer arguments for revising those convictions. Defining "representational redundancy" as the inclusion of any symbols not required to fulfill the study objectives, we cite several sources of redundancy, classified as accidental or intentional, that contribute positively to the model development tasks. Comparative benefits and detriments are discussed briefly. Focusing on the most interesting source of redundancy - that which is intentionally induced by a modeling methodology - we demonstrate that automated elimination of redundancy can actually improve model execution time. Using four models drawn from the literature that are easily understood, but which represent some differences in size and complexity, the direct execution of the graphical representations shows improvements over a base case ranging from 27.3 percent to 68.1 percent in execution time. Further, increasing improvement is realized with increasing model size and complexity. These results are encouraging because they suggest that modeling methodologies with automated model diagnosis can significantly reduce both execution and development time and cost.},

  abstract = {Simulation optimization is often conducted by applying optimization heuristics (e.g., genetic algorithms) whereby the simulation model delivers the objective function value for the respective parameter set. For real world simulation models, their evaluation time is a crucial constraint. This holds especially for material requirements planning (MRP) parameter optimization of real production systems with many products, because of an extensive search space. Approximating the objective function values by surrogate models can be applied to reduce the search space. Based on a real world production system simulation model, the performance of different regression models to identify simple surrogate models for fast objective function approximation is evaluated in this paper. Specifically, a focus is put on the relationship between the MRP parameters: lot-size and planned lead time, and the performance indicators: inventory and tardiness costs. The paper evaluates a set of simple regression models and compares their objective function fit.  2018 IEEE},

  abstract = {Abstraction level of complex simulation models such as large manufacturing systems is always a critical factor in simulation projects. It not only helps define boundaries of a simulation model but also defines the complexity and resource requirements for the model. Many a times a simple looking model grows into a complex model because of incorrect choices in abstraction level. Developing the model in stages or steps of abstraction is sometimes a favored approach. In this paper we study and analyze 'why' and 'how' these choices in abstraction level of a simulation model at various stages in a project's life cycle results in answering the objective function more precisely. Using several automotive manufacturing case studies, We discuss the challenges relating to complexity and methodological issues, and the procedures involved in managing the same.  2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Despite that simulation possesses an establish background and offers tremendous promise for designing and analyzing complex production systems, manufacturing industry has been less successful in using it as a decision support tool, especially in the conceptual phase of factory design. This paper presents how simplification and aggregation strategies are incorporated in a modeling, simulation and analysis tool, with the aim of supporting decision making in conceptual phase. Conceptual modeling is guided by a framework using an object library with generic drag and drop system components and system control objects. Data inputs are simplified by the use of Effective Process Time distributions and a novel aggregation method for product mix cycle time differences. The out coming specification is through a Web Service interface handle by modeling system architecture, automatically generating a simulation model and analysis. Case studies confirm a breakthrough in project time reduction without appreciable effects on the model's fidelity. 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Given the widespread acceptance of the importance of simplicity in management science models, the scarcity of research into simplification is perhaps surprising. In the simulation of manufacturing systems, simplification is often not attempted and, on the (misguided) assumption that more detailed models are necessarily more accurate and therefore better, common practice is to build and use the most complex model that can be built in the time available. However, for cases where the only results required are averages, such as long term throughput rates, it will often be possible to reduce the model to such a simple version that an analytical solution becomes feasible and the simulation redundant. An eight stage procedure is proposed for doing the reductions and two manufacturing case studies are described.  2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a real-time scheduling methodology in a semiconductor wafer fab that produces multiple product types with different due dates. In the suggested real-time scheduling method, lot scheduling rules and batch scheduling rules are selected from sets of candidate rules based on information obtained from discrete event simulation. Since a rule combination that gives the best performance may vary according to the states of the fab, a selected rule combination is employed for a certain period of time and then a new combination is selected and employed. Since multiple simulation runs should be made in the simulation-based real-time scheduling (SBRTS) method, it may take excessively long computation time to react to unexpected events. To reduce response time, we suggest three techniques for accelerating rule comparison. We test these techniques as well as other operational policies that can be used in the SBRTS method through computational experiments on a number of test problems.},

  abstract = {Production planning using simulation has been gaining popularity as manufacturing routings become more complicated. However, a detailed simulation model that contains hundreds of machines and thousands of operations is far too large and complex to work with. The thesis in this research is that production planners at plant level do not need to see all the details of the shop floor to develop an effective production plan. Simulation model used for production planning can be simplified to ensure maintainability and manageability of the model. Model simplification is done in two stages, namely aggregation and condensation. Model aggregation reduces the number of routings in the model by using representative flows, whereas model condensation reduces the number of elements in a model by eliminating high throughput rate workstations. Both strategies reduce the complexity of a simulation model without sacrificing its accuracy. Experimental results using real-life data indicate that the simplified model is a valid representation of the detailed model, and can be used for high level production planning. t-Tests are used to compare the results of the detailed and simplified simulation model. Finally, rules of thumb are developed to standardize the simplification strategy.},

  abstract = {Put simply a model is a representation of 'something else'. Models may take many forms ranging from scaled models used to represent real world physical objects, such as buildings and new consumer products, to sophisticated computer models used to represent quite complex and often abstract systems, such as financial and investment strategies. However since individuals perceive and interpret situations differently, the same can be said for their perceptions and interpretations of what a model might represent. In the case of a model this could include the model builder, users and even members of the public. Fundamental to the model building process, is the selection and use of various abstraction techniques used by model builders to simplify the 'something else' they are seeking to represent. One of the major issues concerned with simplifying 'something else', be it a relatively simple or complex situation, is determining which factors can be confidently removed from the situation without impacting on the reliability and validity of a model that is subsequently built to emulate or represent it. In essence, once a factor or series of factors are removed from a situation, the situation itself is changed. Further, models are often deliberately built and used specifically to form the basis for analysis and investigation over time using simulation techniques, the results of which are then used to support individual and organisational decision making the consequences of which may even impact on innocent third parties. In this context, this paper will provide a brief examination of the concept of simplification and various approaches to simplification utilised by model builders and simulationists. It will then attempt to provide an ethical analysis of the implications associated with how much and what kind of information should model and simulation builders be reasonably required to disclose to potential users of their products so that any decisions these users make on the basis of information obtained from a model or simulation output can be undertaken in the utmost good faith.

  abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive review of discrete event simulation publications published between 2002 and 2013 with a particular focus on applications in manufacturing. The literature is classified into three general classes of manufacturing system design, manufacturing system operation, and simulation language/package development. The paper further categorizes the literature into 11 subclasses based on the application area. The current review contributes to the literature in three significant ways: (1) it provides a wide coverage by reviewing 290 papers; (2) it provides a detailed analysis of different aspects of the literature to identify research trends through innovative data mining approaches as well as insights derived from the review process; and (3) it updates and extends the existing classification schemes through identification and inclusion of recently emerged application areas and exclusion of obsolete categories. The results of the literature analysis are then used to make suggestions for future research.  2013 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.},

  abstract = {Traditional industrial engineering techniques including mathematical models are not sufficient to examine sophisticated manufacturing systems such as semiconductor manufacturing. As such, simulation modeling is used extensively in the design and analysis of semiconductor manufacturing operations. This study explores the use of simulation modeling of single semiconductor toolsets. In the literature a number of modeling approaches for single toolset analysis can be identified. The purpose of this study is to review and evaluate these approaches.  2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Kriging (or a Gaussian process) provides metamodels for deterministic and random simulation models. Actually, there are several types of Kriging; the classic type is the so-called universal Kriging, which includes ordinary Kriging. These classic types require estimation of the trend in the input-output data of the underlying simulation model; this estimation weakens the Kriging metamodel. We therefore consider the so-called intrinsic Kriging (IK), which originated in geostatistics, and derive IK types for deterministic simulations and random simulations, respectively. Moreover, for random simulations, we derive experimental designs that specify the number of replications that varies with the input combination of the simulation model. To compare the performance of IK and classic Kriging, we use several numerical experiments with deterministic simulations and random simulations, respectively. These experiments show that IK gives better metamodels, in most experiments. Copyright  2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Surrogate models are popular tool to approximate the functional relationship of expensive simulation models in multiple scientific and engineering disciplines. Successful use of surrogate models can provide significant savings of computational cost. However, with a variety of surrogate model approaches available in literature, it is a difficult task to select an appropriate one at hand. In this paper, we present an overview of surrogate model approaches with an emphasis of their application for variance-based global sensitivity analysis, including polynomial regression model, high-dimensional model representation, state-dependent parameter, polynomial chaos expansion, Kriging/Gaussian Process, support vector regression, radial basis function, and low rank tensor approximation. The accuracy and efficiency of these approaches are compared with several benchmark examples. The strengths and weaknesses of these surrogate models are discussed, and the recommendations are provided for different types of applications. For ease of implementations, the packages, as well as toolboxes, of surrogate model techniques and their applications for global sensitivity analysis are collected.  2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {This paper is an expanded version of a talk I gave at the 2006 Winter Simulation Conference, which is the premier annual conference in the discrete-event simulation community. Each year, the conference recognizes a 'titan of the industry,' and that person is invited to deliver a 1-h presentation at a plenary session. I was honoured the titan at the 2006 conference. Since this paper was written expressly for members of the simulation community, concepts and terminology peculiar to simulation are not explained. Readers lacking a simulation background may find some portions hard to understand. The goal of this paper is to present ways in which we can deal with complexity. I believe that the explosive growth of complexity is the computing industry's number one problem. It is the root cause of many other problems, such as computer security. Paradoxically, organizations that are in the best positions to deal with complexity are the ones that are, in fact, creating and expanding complexity. In the first section of this paper, I discuss the pervasive presence of complexity in our society in general, and in the simulation community in particular. Complexity is of particular importance to the simulation community, because reducing complexity is our primary activity. We analyse complex systems, build models of them, run the models, and draw inferences that yield more easily understood characterizations of system behaviour. Reduction of complexity lies at the very core of discrete-event simulation. In the second section, I develop a framework of software traits, of which complexity is the most important. I use the framework in succeeding sections to discuss the traits and to illuminate relationships among them. Following my discussion of the framework, I present four interesting examples of the kinds of complexity I've had to face as a software developer. Next, having discussed the evils of complexity, I present a sequence of 12 techniques for reducing, or at least coping with, complexity. Since model development is a form of software development, we all develop software in one way or another. Some of the techniques are most applicable to software development, while others are more general. Finally, I present my conclusions.},

  abstract = {Model abstraction is a method for reducing the complexity of a simulation model while maintaining the validity of the simulation results with respect to the question that the simulation is being used to address. Model developers have traditionally used a number of abstraction techniques, and simulation researchers have conducted formal research to build a theoretical foundation for model manipulation. More recently, researchers in the artificial intelligence (AI) subfield of qualitative simulation have also been developing techniques for simplifying models, determining whether models results are valid, and developing tools for automatic model selection and manipulation. Metamodeling also can be considered as an abstraction technique. The purpose of this paper is to provide a taxonomy of abstraction techniques drawn from these fields. This taxonomy provides a framework for comparing and contrasting various abstraction techniques.},

  abstract = {It is well-known that semiconductor manufacturing is one of the most complex types of production. Consequently, making the right decisions in order to get the optimum output of a semiconductor fab is quite challenging. For that reason, sophisticated discrete event simulation studies may be seen as a kind of magic tool for fab managers to face the ever-increasing complexity. But building complex dynamic simulation models in order to solve complex problems is not always the best solution. This article gives an overview of the discussion about the correct level of complexity of discrete event simulation models and lists the main reasons for the creation of overcomplex models. To provide guidance for practitioners, lessons learned are derived from four "real world" use cases in which the correct level of complexity was a major issue.  2016 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The concept of process abstraction, which allows simu- lationists to construct models composed of a set of interconnected levels, is discussed. Each level in the network represents the process at some given level of abstraction and is encoded using a model type (viz. Petri net, automaton, data flow graph) appropriate to that level. An example process composed of articulated figures around a circular table is presented. The process is formally defined at each level, then the abstraction relationships between levels are discussed. A taxonomy of process abstraction methods is presented in an effort to characterize the fundamental concepts of level traversal. The application involving the animation of the process is described within the context of the HIRES simulation language that was constructed specifically to simulate and analyze multilevel simulations. Textual and graphical examples of HIRES output are included. Finally, some observations on the future of process abstraction in modeling are given.  1988 IEEE},

  abstract = {The author critically examines possibilities for a formal basis of model abstraction and possibilities for procedures to perform model abstraction. It is noted that model abstraction is frequently done by modelers when the complexity of their models exceeds the power of their resources, i.e., too much space or time would be taken by simulations. It is the responsibility of simulation methodologists to propose sound ways of generating more abstract models from more detailed ones. Model abstraction also serves the purpose of learning more about model behavior and inferring properties that otherwise may remain uncovered. It is pointed out that no complete theories of model abstraction exist, nor does any sufficiently general procedure.},

  abstract = {This book is divided into three parts with Part 1 introducing the basic concepts. Part 2 presents the systems theory concepts necessary for an understanding of Part 3, which sets forth the basic framework and discusses a number of issues and problems in modelling and simulation. Chapters 1 and 2 deal with model description and basic systems concepts. With the conceptual basis so developed, the author considers the basic elements of discourse--real system, experimental frame, base model, lumped model, and the computer--and the concepts of simplification, validation, and simulation, which involve relations among the basic elements. Chapters 3 through 7 deal with the dynamics of simulation, that is, with the generation of the temporal behaviour of a model. The concept of state and the formal description of models are developed in parallel with the description of how the computer carries out the simulation process. The last chapter of Part 1 (Chapter 8) returns to the subject of modelling. The author discusses an example of discrete event modelling and introduces the concept of homomorphism as a criterion for valid simplification. Part 2 consists of two chapters. Chapter 9 develops a hierarchy of system specifications ranging from the lowest behavioural level to the highest structural level. Chapter 10 develops a parallel hierarchy of preservation relations that interrelate specifications. Part 3 opens with an axiomization of the basic framework, using the systems concepts. A number of problems common to many domains are isolated and formulated within the framework. (from preface)},

  abstract = {Model-based techniques are, these days, being embraced by the manufacturing industry in their development frameworks. While model-based approaches allow for offline verification and validation before physical commissioning, and have other advantages over existing methods, they do have their own challenges. Firstly, models are typically created manually and hence are prone to errors. Secondly, once a model is created, tested, and put into use on the factory floor, there is an added effort required to maintain and update it. This paper is a preliminary study of the feasibility of automatically obtaining formal models from virtual simulations. We apply the foundational algorithm from the active automata learning community to study the requirements and enhancements needed to be able to derive discrete event models from virtual simulations. An abstract model in the form of operations is learned by applying this algorithm on a simulation model composed of discrete operations. While a major bottleneck to be solved is the generation of counterexamples, the results seem promising to apply model learning in practice.  2018 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Infineon Technologies Dresden uses discrete event simulation to forecast key performance indicators. The simulation has also been used to perform experiments to improve production planning. It is important to reduce the efforts required for the creation and maintenance of the simulation models. Especially for the simulation studies, less detailed models can be utilized where components could be omitted. We considered a simplification of the process flows through operation substitution for constant delays. Different levels of model complexity were investigated. For each level, different tool sets were determined which were substituted for delays. First In First Out and Critical Ratio dispatching rules were used. Lot cycle time distributions were utilized in order to compare simplified models with a detailed model.  2019 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Modeling and Simulation (M&S) is an ever growing field that utilizes increasingly complex and expensive simulations often requiring lots of time to run, can be difficult to maintain and analyze, but whose use continues to provide useful insight into leadership decisions. In a time critical decision situation, running such models may not be a practical approach to provide leadership the insights they need when they need those insights. Bayesian Networks (BN) are a useful analytical tool that offer understandable probabilistic relationships between variables, efficient computation, and quick analytical results. A BN indexed by time is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). A drawback to their use as a meta-model is the number of runs needed to train either the BN or DBN. This research introduces and demonstrates the use of bootstrapping techniques to reduce the number of actual simulation runs necessary to sufficiently train DBNs used as simulation meta-models. DBNs trained with independent simulation runs are compared to DBNs trained with bootstrapped-based samples developed on various sized subsets of actual simulation runs, the DBNs are compared statistically, and empirical examples are used to demonstrate the methodology. A method extending the DBN meta-model to multiple dimensions is presented and demonstrated. A case study using an actual combat simulation model completes the presentation.  2017},

  abstract = {Simulation modeling has been around for many years and produced many papers. Arguably, there has been a lack of impact in the health arena, some may say due to modeling such a large, complex, diverse and often interconnected industry. Other observations suggests that academics get rewarded for publishing large complicated models with detailed analysis rather than focusing on the requirements of the environment or the needs of implementation. This paper attempts to add to the modeling debate by suggesting that average simulation process times can act as estimators for real length of stay. This paper will also illustrate how average process time models could be used to help reconfigure emergency care services models. Average time simulation models have the potential to make a valuable contribution to modeling and they support simplified, transparent models with shortened development time.  2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Previous work has proved that simple simulation models are sufficient for analyzing the behavior of complex wafer fabs in certain scenarios. In this paper, we give an example where the simple model fails to accurately predict cycle times and WIP levels of the complex model. To determine the reason for this behavior, we analyze the correlation properties of a MIMAC full fab model and the corresponding simple one. It turns out that the simple model is not capable of capturing the correlations in an adequate way because there is lot overtaking (passing) in the simple model while almost no overtaking can be found in the complex counterpart.},
