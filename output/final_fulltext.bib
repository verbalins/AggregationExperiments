  abstract = {This paper presents the abstraction process to support a modular approach for simulating semiconductor supply networks by modelling each node in the network as a 'Functional Block'. In particular, a functional block to represent wafer fabrication facilities is developed, which strikes a suitable balance between a high level abstraction and modelling the detailed complexities of a manufacturing facility. We demonstrate that the model is able to produce performance estimates (average Cycle Time (CT) and Throughput (TH)) that resemble the behaviour of real-life systems and are accurate with respect to comparisons with a detailed Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model.  2007, Inderscience Publishers.},

  abstract = {Overcrowding at emergency departments in Hong Kong has been a critical issue for hospital managers recently. In this study, we focus on optimizing the medical staff configuration to alleviate overcrowding. According to the service requirements proposed by the Hong Kong government, 90% of urgent patients should receive treatment within 30 min. However, this condition is rarely satisfied in the practical situation. Therefore, we formulate the problem as minimizing the proportion of urgent patients that violate the service requirements while satisfying the service requirements of the other categories and cost constraints, thereby resulting in an optimization problem with a stochastic objective and several stochastic constraints. To solve this problem efficiently, we proposed a multi-fidelity simulation optimization framework containing a low- and a high-fidelity process. We utilize an evolutionary algorithm with violation-constrained handling assisted by a surrogate model as a low-fidelity process to shrink the solution space and generate an elite population. In the high-fidelity process, we exploit the optimal computing budget allocation method to identify the best solution in the elite population based on a data-driven simulation model. A case study is also discussed, and the results demonstrated that with a limited labor cost, there is a 52.05% reduction on average in the waiting time of urgent patients. Meanwhile, our proposed multi-fidelity simulation optimization framework proves to save 98.4% of the simulation time.  2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Cycle Time - Throughput curves (CT-TH), which plot the average cycle time versus start rate for a given product mix, are often used to support decisions made in manufacturing settings, such as the impact of proposed changes in start rate on mean cycle time. Discrete event simulation is often used to generate estimations of cycle time at a significant number of traffic intensities (start rates). However, simulation often requires long run lengths and extensive output analysis. In most manufacturing environments, the time and/or budget available for such simulations is limited. As demands for faster and more accurate results are required, alternative approaches to improving simulation efficiency must be investigated. This research seeks to develop a procedure for simplifying a detailed model into a fast (abstract) simulation model that achieves a statistically indistinguishable level of accuracy and precision. This technique has particular application in the simulation of semiconductor manufacturing facilities.},

  abstract = {In this paper a method is presented for mapping the simulation state between models of different level of detail in dynamic multiresolution modeling of discrete event material flow systems. In dynamic multiresolution modeling it is possible to inactivate a model part of certain detail and activate a model of higher or lower detail representing the same part of the system during simulation. To allow a consistent simulation, the state of the inactivated model has to be mapped to the activated model. The mapping is done by first mapping the jobs, then mapping the breakdown status and statistical variables. Experiments show that consistent states are generated, such that the simulation continues after state mapping. The errors generated by mapping are small and caused by the loss of information in the models of lower detail.  2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {In new Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, product-driven systems (PDS) architectures require emulation tool (Thomas, A., Genin, P., and Lamouri, S., 2008. Mathematical programming approaches for stable tactical and operational planning in supply chain and APS context. Journal of Decision Systems, 17, 425-455) to be developed. Discrete events simulation is often used to build such an emulation tool, nevertheless this remains complex because of large-scale problems. The goal of this article is to propose a way to design a simulation model by reducing its complexity. According to the theory of constraints, we build reduced models composed exclusively of bottlenecks and a neural network. In particular, a multilayer perceptron is used. The structure of the network is determined using a pruning procedure. This study highlights the impact of discrete data on the computational results. An application to a sawmill internal supply chain is suggested to validate the proposed approach.  2011 Taylor & Francis.},

  abstract = {Production planning optimization remains a major challenge in almost all industries, particularly in high-tech manufacturing. A critical task to support such optimization is performance evaluation, wherein an accurate estimation of the cycle time as a function of the throughput rate plays a key role. This paper develops a novel aggregation model based on a queueing network approach, so-called queue-based aggregation (QAG) model, to estimate the cycle time of a job-shop production system that consists of several processing workstations, and in which products are transferred via an Automated Material Handling System (AMHS). The proposed model aggregates both production and automated material handling systems and provides an accurate and fast estimation of the overall cycle time. The performance and superiority of the proposed model is validated by comparing its results with those of a detailed simulation model. Numerous sensitivity analyses are performed to provide valuable managerial insights on both the production and automated material handling systems.  2019},

  abstract = {In this paper, a supply chain simulation testbed for the semiconductor industry is proposed. We start by identifying requirements for such reference datasets, and then we identify the main building blocks. The nodes of the supply chain that represent semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities (wafer fabs) are built on a simulation model from the measurement and improvement of manufacturing capacity project. We present two techniques to reduce the modeling and computational burden that are able to deal with load-dependent cycle times in single front-end and back-end facilities and in the overall network. The first method models in detail only the bottlenecks in the nodes of the supply chain, while the second one uses empirical distributions for cycle time and throughput. The quality of these reduction techniques is assessed by comparing the detailed model and the models with a reduced level of detail. We present an application scenario for the testbed by simulating a semiconductor supply network. In addition, the usage of the testbed is discussed.  2017 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Performance evaluation using queueing models is common practice in semiconductor manufacturing. Analytical closed-form expressions and simulation models are popular in capacity planning and the analysis of equipment configurations. However, the complexity of semiconductor processes complicates the modeling of the equipment. Analytical models lack the required accuracy, whereas simulation models require too many details, making them impractical. Aggregation is a way to overcome this difficulty. The various details are not modeled in detail, but their contribution is lumped in the aggregate model, which makes the model more appropriate for both analysis and simulation. This paper gives an overview of our efforts to develop a top-down aggregate modeling approach for semiconductor equipment, starting from the effective process time concept inspired by the Factory Physics book of Hopp and Spearman. The strong feature of our modeling approach is that the aggregate model parameters are estimated directly from industrial data (arrival and departure times), without the need to quantify the various details.  2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) requires expensive diagnostic equipment and is labor intensive. To evaluate the effective use of the MRI resources a curve of flow time versus throughput may be helpful in quantifying the trade-off between patient waiting time and resource utilization, and in providing insight into operational time losses and variability. This curve may be obtained by simulation. However, building a detailed simulation model of an MRI department requires expertise typically unavailable in hospitals. To overcome this difficulty, we seek for an appropriate aggregate model of the MRI department, either a simulation or an analytical model. The aggregate model parameters are to be determined from hospital patient arrival and departure times. We study three different aggregate models for use in the MRI setting. To be able to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the candidate aggregate models we use a detailed simulation model as virtual MRI department.  2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Concepts for aggregate modeling and simulation are presented and applied for the setting of the parameters of a CONWIP flow control system within the steel products cell at Grand Rapids Chair, a high-mix, low-volume manufacturing environment. Aggregation was accomplished by combining the over 100 types of products into one. This resulted in a single arrival process, routing modeled as random movement through workstations, and a single operation time distribution for each production operation. Aggregation reduced the effort required for model development, data analysis, validation, and simulation. The CONWIP control was shown to be effective in managing the work-in-process. A CONWIP parameter of 50 resulted in an equivalent throughput to that achieved with no limit on work-in-process. Lead time can be reduced by approximately 20% by increasing the CONWIP parameter to 58.  2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

  abstract = {The semiconductor sector is undergoing one of the fastest market growths. Demand is increasing and market forecasts are optimistic. New markets are emerging and product portfolios are broadening significantly. Dynamic supply chains are developing with increasing number of customers, products, suppliers and manufacturing partnerships. Up to now due to modeling complexity and computation time constraints, disjoint systems are used for local supply chain control and optimization. For efficient control, these complex semiconductor supply chains require a global approach for simulation and optimization. This is the motivation for this conceptual paper. In the conceptual part this paper introduces and discusses novel model aggregation approaches and model validity improvements with novel hierarchical modeling concepts. In the modeling part this paper incorporates that into an aggregated simulation model approach as well as a novel hierarchical interface concept for coupling of disaggregated analytical and simulation models to systematically improve overall model validity at Bosch.  2018 IEEE},

  abstract = {In conceptual analysis of higher level manufacturing systems, for instance when the constraint on system level is sought, it may not be very practical to use detailed simulation models. Developing detailed models on supply chain level or plant wide level may be very time consuming and might also be computationally costly to execute, especially if optimization techniques are to be applied. Aggregation techniques, simplifying a detailed system into fewer objects, can be an effective method to reduce the required computational resources and to shorten the development time. An aggregated model can be used to identify the main system constraints, dimensioning inter-line buffers, and focus development activities on the critical issues from a system performance perspective. In this paper a novel line aggregation technique suitable for manufacturing systems optimization is proposed, analyzed and tested in order to establish a proof of concept while demonstrating the potential of the technique.  2015 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This paper formulates an overall line effectiveness (OLE) improvement scheme for a production line on the basis of Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST) and stochastic Kriging (SK) surrogate model. It is known that improving the key parameters that have great influence on the target performance can bring better effect on the performance than improving other parameters. Thus this paper is concentrated on improving the OLE of a production line through improving multiple key parameters related to the OLE. In the proposed procedure, FAST is used to identify the key parameters for the OLE and a SK surrogate model is built to evaluate the OLE of the production line instead of a simulation model, improving the work efficiency effectively. At last, a comparison with the continuous improvement process (CIP) shows that the scheme formulated with FAST and SK surrogate model is easier to be implemented than the one generated by CIP, because the procedure provided in this paper can give further suggestion to improve the OLE when the improvement of the bottleneck is limited.  2018 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of supply chain or workshop management is often based on simulation. This simulation task needs models which are difficult to design. The aim of this work is to reduce the complexity of simulation model design and to partially automate this task by combining discrete and continuous approaches in order to construct more efficient and reduced model. Model design focuses on bottlenecks with a discrete approach according to the theory of constraints. The remaining of the workshop is modeled in a less precise way by using continuous model in order to describe only how the bottlenecks are fed. This used continuous model is a regression tree algorithm. For validation, this approach is applied to the modeling of a sawmill workshop and the results are compared with results obtained previously by using a neural network model.

  abstract = {In this paper a method for controlled simplification is presented, which is able to create simplified models with specific properties concerning complexity and behavioral deviation automatically. The method requires a finite set of model component classes, of which instances a user-defined model can be created. Two techniques for simplification are used: aggregation, where a large set of components is substituted by a small set, and omission, where components are deleted without compensation. A set of simplification rules concerning the simplification techniques, the component classes and the model structures line and parallel line are defined. These rules are used by a simplification algorithm, which is embedded in a control loop of complexity measurement and behavior measurement. 2009 IEEE.},

Simulation of supply chains can help in these objectives by evaluating the impact of alternate inventory control policies. Supply chain simulation involves modeling of multiple factories across the chain and can get quite complex. Analysts typically carry out such simulation at a coarse level of detail to keep the complexity and computing resources manageable. However, modeling at coarse levels may reduce the accuracy of outputs and affect the quality of decisions. In this paper, we report on a study to compare the quality of results at different levels of details in a semiconductor supply chain simulation.},

  abstract = {Semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities (wafer fabs) are among the most complex production facilities. A large product variety, hundreds of processing steps per product, hundreds of machines of different types, and automated transport lead to a system complexity which is hard to understand and hard to handle. For educating planners and developing adequate material flow control mechanisms, simple models for this complex environment are required. Several years ago, we published some first approaches which were useful to explain the fab behavior after a serious bottleneck breakdown. With that simple model, however, it was only possible to predict the cycle time distribution of the lots for a few scenarios. In this paper, we present some model improvements which lead to a rather good cycle time prediction for a variety of load situations.  2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {As the costs of building a new wafer fab increase, a detailed simulation model representing the production operations, the tools, the automated material handling systems (AMHS), and the tool-AMHS interactions is needed for accurately planning the capacity of these facilities. The problem is that it currently takes too long to build, experiment, and analyze a sufficiently detailed model of a fab. The key for building accurate and computationally efficient fab models is to decide on the right amount of model details, specifically those details representing the equipment capacity and the AMHS. This paper identifies a method for classifying a fab model by the level of capacity detail, the level of AMHS detail, or the level of capacity/AMHS detail. Within the capacity/AMHS modeling level, our method further differentiates between detailed integrated capacity/AMHS models and abstract coupled capacity/AMHS models. The proposed classification method serves as the basis of a framework that helps users select the system components to be modeled within a desired level of detail. This research also provides a review of past-published literature summarizing the work done at each of the proposed fab modeling levels. A case study comparing the performance between an integrated capacity/AMHS model and a coupled capacity/AMHS model is presented. The study demonstrates that the coupled model generates cycle time estimates that are not statistically different than those generated by the integrated model. This paper also shows that the coupled model can improve CPU time by approximately 98% in relation to the integrated model.  2008 IEEE.},

  abstract = {In many situations, simulation models are developed to handle complex real-world business optimisation problems. In our case, a discrete-event simulation model is used to simulate trailer management and fleet configuration in a big Fast-Moving Consumer Goods company. To address the problem of finding suitable simulation inputs for optimisation, we propose a simulation optimisation approach. The simulation optimisation model combines metaheuristic search (genetic algorithm), with an approximation model filter (feed-forward neural network) to optimise the input configuration of the simulation model. In this work, we introduce an ensure probability that overrules the rejection of potential solutions by the approximation model and demonstrate its effectiveness. In addition, we evaluate the impact of the genetic algorithm parameters and show how population size, filter threshold, and mutation probability impact overall fleet optimisation performance. Lastly, we compare the proposed method with a single global approximation model and a random-based approach, our results demonstrate the advantage of our method in terms of computational time and solution quality.},

  abstract = {Simulation model is extensively used for evaluation of dispatching rules in semiconductor wafer fabrication. However, due to the high complexity of the simulation model, the simulation is so time-consuming that it cannot response to the dynamic changes of practical fabrication well. In order to reduce computer execution time and in the same time maintain the ability of the model to evaluate the scheduling rules correctly, a model reduction method based on selective clustering ensemble algorithm (SCEA) and Theory of Constraints (TOC) is proposed. Firstly, SCEA is adopted to identify the unimportant machines steadily, in which multiple base clusterings (BCs) are trained by k-means with different initial cluster centers and then are combined into a final result based on selective weight-voting strategy. Secondly, unimportant machines are removed from the detailed model, since such machines may not significantly affect the performance of the system, according to TOC. Thirdly, closed-loop correction structure is built to ensure the robustness of the reduced model. Finally, the reduced simulation model is used to evaluate the dispatching rules respectively with the scheduling objective of on-time delivery (OTD) rate, mean cycle time (MCT) and throughput. The simulation results show that the method presented is available and effective.  2016 IEEE.},

A main weakness of simulation is the long computation time. In this paper, we aim at simplifying the models of fabrication facilities to reduce simulation time and meanwhile keep the ability of evaluating rules correctly. We propose a metric to assess how well a simplified model evaluates rules and formulate the model simplification problem as a multiobjective optimization problem. We also develop an evolutionary algorithm to solve the formulated problem.

  abstract = {In the manufacturing industry, target-oriented and efficient use of resources is gaining importance, alongside economic optimization. The economic and organizational optimization of manufacturing systems according to the lean principles is only partly compatible with the goals of resource-efficient manufacturing. Therefore, an approach is sought to improve individual analyses of manufacturing systems. This paper proposes an approach for the multi-objective optimization of lean and resource-efficient manufacturing systems. To predict the dynamic effects of several configurations of manufacturing systems, material, energy, and information flows of a discrete event simulation are coupled with an assessment model, based on objectives of lean and resource-efficient manufacturing. Using design of experiments, Gaussian process meta-models are computed for the behavior of the simulation model. These meta-models allow the approximation of the system behavior to be computed in a short period of time and enable extensive multi-objective optimization and more adequate decision-making support systems. The proposed approach is tested in the metalworking industry.  2020, German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP).},

  abstract = {Simulation is often used to evaluate supply chain or workshop management. This simulation task needs models, which are difficult to construct. The aim of this work is to reduce the complexity of a simulation model design. The proposed approach combines discrete and continuous approaches in order to construct speeder and simpler reduced model. The simulation model focuses on bottlenecks with a discrete approach according to the theory of constraints. The remaining of the workshop must be taken into account in order to describe how the bottlenecks are fed. It is modeled through a continuous approach thanks to a neural network. In particular, we use a multilayer perceptron. The structure of the network is determined by using a pruning procedure. For validation, this approach is applied to the modelisation of a sawmill workshop.  2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Reacting quickly to changing market demands and new variants by improving and adapting industrial systems is an important business advantage. Changes to systems are costly; especially when those systems are already in place. Resources invested should be targeted so that the results of the improvements are maximized. One method allowing this is the combination of discrete event simulation, aggregated models, multi-objective optimization, and data-mining shown in this article. A real-world optimization case study of an industrial problem is conducted resulting in lowering the storage levels, reducing lead time, and lowering batch sizes, showing the potential of optimizing on the factory level. Furthermore, a base for decision-support is presented, generating clusters from the optimization results. These clusters are then used as targets for a decision tree algorithm, creating rules for reaching different solutions for a decision-maker to choose from. Thereby allowing decisions to be driven by data, and not by intuition.  2019, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {To predict cycle time distributions of integrated processing workstations, detailed simulation models are almost exclusively used; these models require considerable development and maintenance effort. As an alternative, we propose an aggregate model that is a lumped-parameter representation of the workstation. The aggregate model is a single server with a work-in-process dependent aggregate process time distribution and overtaking distribution. The lumped parameters are determined directly from arrival and departure events measured at the workstation. An extensive simulation study and an industry case demonstrate that the aggregate model can accurately predict the cycle time distribution of integrated processing workstations in semiconductor manufacturing.  2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Even today, medium-term production scheduling tends to be unsatisfactory in many industrial enterprises because it is usually based on escapist assumptions of fixed lead times and a mere summarising of the capacity supply and demand. These assumptions and the simplicity of the methods applied do not match the complexity of the scheduling problems to be solved. Thus the goals of the scheduling frequently fail to be achieved. Help might be at hand from simulation-based optimisation. Such optimisation, however, causes high computational costs, which will stand in the way of its practical application. This article reports a method of creating reduced simulation models of discrete production processes. The use of such reduced models instead of detailed ones lessens the computational costs considerably and hence makes the application of simulation-based optimisation for medium-term production scheduling possible. The reduction method was subjected to empirical investigation, the results of which are also presented here.},

  abstract = {Accurate and simple simulation flow model is useful to make decision at the right time to manage supply chain or workshop. To do that, different reduction model complexity approaches have been proposed. One of them is to associate discrete event model of bottlenecks and continuous model of other work centers according to the theory of constraints. The continuous approximation is used only do determine how the bottlenecks are fed. Different continuous model have been proposed in the past. This paper focuses on the association of regression trees and neural networks in order to benefit of the advantages of each other. This approach is used for the modeling of a sawmill workshop and the results are compared with those obtained previously by using only CART model or neural network model.  2015 International Institute for Innovation, Industrial Engineering and Entrepreneurship - I4e2.},

However, once the MPS is released, daily events may require it to be brought into question. The use of reduced models within the framework of flow dynamic simulation enables quick decision-making while maximizing the use of resources and minimizing risk. The article shows the advantage of model reduction and how we arrive at it. Afterwards we develop an analysis of the influence of the model factors by highlighting the differences between the simulation results and MPS. Finally we show the circumstances in which the flow dynamic simulation with reduced models is relevant.  2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Simulation optimization is often conducted by applying optimization heuristics (e.g., genetic algorithms) whereby the simulation model delivers the objective function value for the respective parameter set. For real world simulation models, their evaluation time is a crucial constraint. This holds especially for material requirements planning (MRP) parameter optimization of real production systems with many products, because of an extensive search space. Approximating the objective function values by surrogate models can be applied to reduce the search space. Based on a real world production system simulation model, the performance of different regression models to identify simple surrogate models for fast objective function approximation is evaluated in this paper. Specifically, a focus is put on the relationship between the MRP parameters: lot-size and planned lead time, and the performance indicators: inventory and tardiness costs. The paper evaluates a set of simple regression models and compares their objective function fit.  2018 IEEE},

  abstract = {Given the widespread acceptance of the importance of simplicity in management science models, the scarcity of research into simplification is perhaps surprising. In the simulation of manufacturing systems, simplification is often not attempted and, on the (misguided) assumption that more detailed models are necessarily more accurate and therefore better, common practice is to build and use the most complex model that can be built in the time available. However, for cases where the only results required are averages, such as long term throughput rates, it will often be possible to reduce the model to such a simple version that an analytical solution becomes feasible and the simulation redundant. An eight stage procedure is proposed for doing the reductions and two manufacturing case studies are described.  2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a real-time scheduling methodology in a semiconductor wafer fab that produces multiple product types with different due dates. In the suggested real-time scheduling method, lot scheduling rules and batch scheduling rules are selected from sets of candidate rules based on information obtained from discrete event simulation. Since a rule combination that gives the best performance may vary according to the states of the fab, a selected rule combination is employed for a certain period of time and then a new combination is selected and employed. Since multiple simulation runs should be made in the simulation-based real-time scheduling (SBRTS) method, it may take excessively long computation time to react to unexpected events. To reduce response time, we suggest three techniques for accelerating rule comparison. We test these techniques as well as other operational policies that can be used in the SBRTS method through computational experiments on a number of test problems.},

  abstract = {Production planning using simulation has been gaining popularity as manufacturing routings become more complicated. However, a detailed simulation model that contains hundreds of machines and thousands of operations is far too large and complex to work with. The thesis in this research is that production planners at plant level do not need to see all the details of the shop floor to develop an effective production plan. Simulation model used for production planning can be simplified to ensure maintainability and manageability of the model. Model simplification is done in two stages, namely aggregation and condensation. Model aggregation reduces the number of routings in the model by using representative flows, whereas model condensation reduces the number of elements in a model by eliminating high throughput rate workstations. Both strategies reduce the complexity of a simulation model without sacrificing its accuracy. Experimental results using real-life data indicate that the simplified model is a valid representation of the detailed model, and can be used for high level production planning. t-Tests are used to compare the results of the detailed and simplified simulation model. Finally, rules of thumb are developed to standardize the simplification strategy.},

  abstract = {Infineon Technologies Dresden uses discrete event simulation to forecast key performance indicators. The simulation has also been used to perform experiments to improve production planning. It is important to reduce the efforts required for the creation and maintenance of the simulation models. Especially for the simulation studies, less detailed models can be utilized where components could be omitted. We considered a simplification of the process flows through operation substitution for constant delays. Different levels of model complexity were investigated. For each level, different tool sets were determined which were substituted for delays. First In First Out and Critical Ratio dispatching rules were used. Lot cycle time distributions were utilized in order to compare simplified models with a detailed model.  2019 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Previous work has proved that simple simulation models are sufficient for analyzing the behavior of complex wafer fabs in certain scenarios. In this paper, we give an example where the simple model fails to accurately predict cycle times and WIP levels of the complex model. To determine the reason for this behavior, we analyze the correlation properties of a MIMAC full fab model and the corresponding simple one. It turns out that the simple model is not capable of capturing the correlations in an adequate way because there is lot overtaking (passing) in the simple model while almost no overtaking can be found in the complex counterpart.},
