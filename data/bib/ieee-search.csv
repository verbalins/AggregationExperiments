Model developers have traditionally used a number of abstraction techniques, and simulation researchers have conducted formal research to build a theoretical foundation for model manipulation. More recently, researchers in the artificial intelligence (AI) subfield of qualitative simulation have also been developing techniques for simplifying models, determining whether models results are valid, and developing tools for automatic model selection and manipulation. Metamodeling can also be considered as an abstraction technique. The purpose of the paper is to provide a taxonomy of abstraction techniques drawn from these fields.

The mechatronic systems are always composed of a number of subsystems with various controllers, and they are large scale systems. The models of large scale systems are always resulted in complex form and high in dimension, making the computation for modeling, simulation and control design become very complicated, or even beyond the solutions provided by conventional engineering methods. Therefore, a simplified model obtained by using model order reduction technique, which can preserve the dominant physical parameters and reveal the performance limiting factor, is preferred. This paper employs a two-wheeled self-balancing scooter as the subject of the study in research on large scale mechatronic system. Efforts have been put on developing a completed mathematical modeling method based on a unified framework from variational method for both mechanical subsystem and electrical subsystem in the scooter. In order to decrease the computation efforts in simulation and control design, Routh model reduction technique was chosen from various model reduction techniques so as to obtain a low dimensional model. Matlab simulation is used to predict the system response based on the simplified model and related control design.

Common Rail or ABS systems, consist of a large number of components from different physical domains. The interaction of these components is essential for the function and behavior of the overall system. During the early stages of the development process simulation models are strongly required for the verification of alternative designs and parametrizations. Furthermore, these models are necessary for the understanding of the overall system. Due to the complexity of the technical system, each component can be described by different models on different levels of abstraction. Since components mostly consist of parts from different physical domains (e. g. injection valve consists of power stage, solenoid, nozzle needle), a large variety of domain specific simulation tools are used. Using different simulation tools during the product development is efficient only if model exchange between the tools is supported. However, model exchange between different tools is difficult due to tool specific model description languages, capabilities of the numerical solvers, etc. In this paper, a pragmatic approach to overcome the above mentioned problems is presented. A systematic description of the design process is presented. Starting from this process, the concept of a tool independent standard simulation library is derived. This library currently supports the model exchange between the simulation tools AMESIM, ASCET, SABER and SIMULINK as well as the modeling language vhdl-ams. The usefulness of the concept is illustrated at components of a Common Rail injection system.","","978-3-9524173-5-5","10.23919/ECC.1999.7099734","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7099734","Simulation of mechatronic systems;model exchange;VHDL-AMS;Common Rail","Mathematical model;Standards;Numerical models;Libraries;Rails;Mechatronics;Integrated circuit modeling","digital simulation;mechanical engineering computing;mechatronics;specification languages","tool independent standard simulation library;pragmatic approach;model exchange;model simplification;mechatronic system;abstraction level;domain specific simulation tool;AMESIM tool;ASCET tool;SABER tool;Simulink tool;VHDL-AMS modeling language;common rail injection system","","","","8","","4 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Reducing the order of systems does not necessarily result in improvement in simulation time. What really affects the simulation time is the network complexity, which is determined by both the size and density of the network. Only reducing the size may worsen the density and in turn the complexity of the “reduced” system may be even higher compared with the original systems. We thus proposed a model complexity reduction which comprises sparsity-aware model reduction followed by model sparsification. Experiments show that for realistic post-layout simulation problems, the proposed model complexity reduction provides 3X~5X speed-ups compared with simulation using the original circuits.","","978-1-4799-2334-2","10.1109/EDSSC.2014.7061232","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7061232","model order reduction;post-layout circuits;sparsification;massive terminal","Complexity theory;Artificial neural networks;Accuracy;Voltage-controlled oscillators","circuit layout;circuit simulation","sparsity aware model reduction;post layout circuit simulation;model complexity reduction;model sparsification","","1","","9","","16 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is the responsibility of simulation methodologists to propose sound ways of generating more abstract models from more detailed ones. Model abstraction also serves the purpose of learning more about model behavior and inferring properties that otherwise may remain uncovered.

In an attempt to support the development of hybrid simulation models based on hyPDEVS, we present a domain-specific model abstraction for industrial facilities that is intended to allow developing application models in a platform-independent manner.

In this case, SysML system models should be transformed to domain-specific models, e.g. executable simulation models suitable for specific simulation tools. This paper identifies the key issues for efficient SysML model simulation, utilizing Model Driven Architecture (MDA) concepts. The generation of executable simulation code from SysML system models is considered as a model transformation from the SysML meta-model to the simulation meta-model. Since SysML meta-model is defined using Meta-Object Facility (MOF), the definition of MOF simulation meta-models and the utilization of the Query/View/Transformation (QVT) language for model transformations are analytically discussed. The presented approach is not restricted in a specific simulation framework or type.

To aid in the automatic generation of multi-formalism modelling and simulation tools, formalisms are modelled in their own right, at a metalevel, within an appropriate formalism. This approach is implemented in the interactive tool ATOM/sup 3/ (A Tool for Multi-formalism Meta-Modelling). This tool is used to describe formalisms commonly used in the simulation of dynamical systems, as well as to generate custom tools to process (create, edit, simulate, etc.) models expressed in the corresponding formalism. ATOM/sup 3/ relies on graph rewriting techniques to perform the transformations (modelled as graph grammars) between formalisms as well as for other tasks, such as code generation or simulator specification. The finite state automata (FSA) formalism is used to demonstrate the concepts of meta-modelling as well as model transformation (in particular, simulation of FSA models). The issue of a neutral model exchange and re-use format is addressed in the context of meta-modelling. Core XML is proposed as a standard external format. Thanks to the power of the meta-modelling approach, DTD, XMLSchema, and XSLT specifications may be replaced by models, externally represented in core XML, in appropriate formalisms (entity relationship for syntax and graph grammar for transformation respectively).","","0-7803-7614-5","10.1109/WSC.2002.1172936","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1172936","","Computational modeling;XML;Power system modeling;Bonding;Computer science;Computer simulation;Automata;Context modeling;Differential equations;Petri nets","graph grammars;rewriting systems;large-scale systems;hypermedia markup languages;digital simulation;modelling;finite automata","multi-formalism modelling;metamodelling;computer assisted modelling;computer assisted simulation;complex systems;interactive tool;dynamical systems;graph rewriting;code generation;simulator specification;finite state automata;neutral model exchange format;neutral model reuse format;XML;DTD;XMLSchema;XSLT specifications;graph grammar;entity relationship;syntax;transformation","","10","","8","","29 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

No. 2000/044)","6 Aug 2002","2000","","","2/1","2/7","Concerns the development of a dynamic model of a 5-ply board machine producing packaging board. Three models were developed in decreasing order of complexity. First a detailed dynamic model of the short circulations was built using Simons IDEAS, which is a special purpose dynamic simulation package intended for the pulp and paper industry. This full model contained a comprehensive differential and algebraic equation set so consequently quickly became too unwieldy for the intended uses of troubleshooting, aiding retrofits and model-based control studies. A slightly simplified version of this model was re-engineered in Simulink, dropping the algebraic constraint equations and implementing the transport delays in a more elegant manner. Finally transfer function models, suitable for online control and optimisation tasks were identified from production data with a structure given by semi-rigorous reasoning. All three models were adjusted and subsequently validated against almost one year of plant operating data. This paper highlights the difficulties in validating a large industrial system with widely varying time constants, dubious transducers and the ubiquitous noise. We also discuss the necessary, but delicate, task of performing model reduction; contrast different simulation tools used at the various levels of model hierarchy and finally the paper demonstrates the use of simplified models to improve the performance of the adaptive IMC controller for the basis weight in the finished board.","","","10.1049/ic:20000236","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=848172","","","paper industry","large-scale dynamic paper machine model;5-ply board machine;packaging board;IDEAS;special purpose dynamic simulation package;pulp industry;paper industry;differential equations;algebraic equations;model-based control;model re-engineering;Simulink;algebraic constraint equations;transport delays;transfer function models;online control;online optimisation;semi-rigorous reasoning;model reduction;model hierarchy;adaptive IMC controller;basis weight controller","","1","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The focus of the current paper is to present an efficient simulation flow for prediction of three-dimensional temperature fields at transient operating conditions with multiple heat sources and associated thermal cross talk at component and system levels. In what follows, we will demonstrate the virtual assembly of an electronic control unit (ECU)and its transient thermal simulation in time domain. We will decompose the unit into its major components for which fast mathematical models will be derived by means of model order reduction techniques. We will then create a reduced mathematical model of the entire ECU by simply interconnecting all components models at predetermined IO/s.

The main idea of the proposed framework is to reduce uncertainty by cascading two different Model Order Reduction (MOR) approaches, the BT technique and the Jordan Recurrent Neural Network (JRNN). The reduced model obtained by the JRNN network is estimated using the Instrument Variable (IV) estimation approach. Finally, the BT reduced model and the estimated JRNN reduced model are cascaded to obtain the final reduced order version of the original plant. The cascading procedure takes the powerfulness of both techniques and present them in a single system capable to compensate for possible errors and uncertainties.

In order to implement the pre-evaluation, the system architecture needs to be transformed to the simulation model of the system under the directing of the evaluation requirement model, then the evaluation can be done based on the evaluation model and the data from simulation. The architecture, evaluation requirement model, simulation model and evaluation model involved in the above process constitute the model system (a set of models related with each other) of our approach. Through the modeling activities based on the model system, we can implement the systematically pre-evaluation of SoS. The model system and its meta-model, which are the core of our approach, are detailed after the introduction of the framework of our approach. Then the transformations from DoDAF architecture to evaluation requirement model and simulation model are studied for accelerating the evaluation process.

The various details are not modeled in detail, but their contribution is lumped in the aggregate model, which makes the model more appropriate for both analysis and simulation.

Different knowledge domains are involved in this context such as electronic system design, software engineering, control theory, and real-time systems. A further important aspect of cyber-physical systems is communication which represents the links among sensors, computational units and actuators.The tutorial will introduce to various aspects of modeling, simulation, design and validation of heterogeneous cyberphysical systems involving discrete and continuous components, but will particularly focus on the communication aspects of cyber-physical systems. It will overview the relevant research results and literature, and will discuss several examples taken from tele-operation, transportation, energy management, healthcare and complex machines. The lecture will introduce the most important issues and challenges in the development of cyber-physical systems and how these crucial aspects can be addressed in the design flow. Then an overview of modeling, simulation and verification of cyber-physical systems will be provided. In particular, the lecture will describe different techniques to simulate complex cyber-physical systems. The lecture will present advantages and disadvantages of each technique also from the perspective of computational demand. In particular, a novel approach to speed-up simulation is represented by model abstraction which reduces useless details while preserving the aspects of interest.

Therefore, a precise dynamic aggregated model is indispensable for the displacement of the large-scale PV system. The structure-preservation based aggregated model with comprehensive equivalent parameters for large-scale PV system is proposed in this paper. A complete two-stage PV system model is established to analyze the dynamics of the system. Then, the aggregation method is obtained by comparing the dynamic equations of the detailed model with the aggregated model, which is based on the energy relationship in the PV system. Furthermore, four different case studies are considered including the aggregation of identical and different ten parallel-connected PV units both under the same irradiance condition, and the aggregation of different ten parallel-connected PV units under different irradiance and weak grid scenarios, where the aggregation models are obtained through the proposed equivalent modeling method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed aggregation method is verified by the simulation results from PSCAD/EMTDC platform, and the consistency between the aggregated model and the detailed model is confirmed under different disturbances of irradiance variation, and continuous symmetric and asymmetric grid faults.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2962303","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; State Key Laboratory Of Alternate Electrical Power System With Renewable Energy Sources; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8943117","Photovoltaic system;aggregation method;structure-preservation;equivalent parameters;model consistency","Inverters;Mathematical model;Integrated circuit modeling;Computational modeling;Power system dynamics;Analytical models;Perturbation methods","dynamic response;invertors;photovoltaic power systems;power grids;power system CAD;power system faults","grid faults;EMTDC platform;PSCAD platform;two-stage inverters;dynamic response;equivalent modeling;electromagnetic simulation;simulation model;large-scale photovoltaic generator;large-scale photovoltaic system;structure-preservation model aggregation","","","","29","CCBY","25 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Electrical conduction among cardiac tissue is commonly modeled with a partial differential equation, i.e., reaction-diffusion equation, where the reaction term describes cellular excitation and diffusion term describes electrical propagation. Cellular excitation can be modeled by either detailed human cellular models or simplified models such as the FitzHugh-Nagumo model; electrical propagation can be simulated using either biodomain or mono-domain tissue model. However, existing cardiac models have a great level of complexity, and the simulation is often time-consuming. This paper develops a new spatiotemporal model as a surrogate model of the time-consuming cardiac model. Specifically, we propose to investigate the auto-regressive convolutional neural network (AR-CNN) and convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) to model the spatial and temporal structure for the metamodeling. Model predictions are compared to the one-dimensional simulation data to validate the prediction accuracy. The metamodel can accurately capture the properties of the individual cardiac cell, as well as the electrical wave morphology in cardiac fiber at different simulation scenarios, which demonstrates its superior performance in modeling and the long-term prediction.","2161-8089","978-1-7281-0356-3","10.1109/COASE.2019.8842902","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8842902","","Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Biological system modeling;Data models;Predictive models;Metamodeling","bioelectric phenomena;bioelectric potentials;biological tissues;cardiology;cellular biophysics;differential equations;diseases;electrocardiography;neural nets;neurophysiology;partial differential equations;reaction-diffusion systems;spatiotemporal phenomena","model predictions;temporal structure;spatial structure;short-term memory;auto-regressive convolutional neural network;time-consuming cardiac model;surrogate model;simulation scenarios;spatiotemporal model;existing cardiac models;mono-domain tissue model;biodomain domain tissue model;FitzHugh-Nagumo model;detailed human cellular models;electrical propagation;diffusion term;cellular excitation;reaction term;reaction-diffusion equation;cardiac tissue;treatment design;cardiac disease mechanism;clinical study;cardiac research;cardiac electrical conduction simulation;physics-based deep spatio-temporal metamodeling;one-dimensional simulation data;metamodel;individual cardiac cell;electrical wave morphology;cardiac fiber;long-term prediction","","","","18","","19 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such models are really complex and hard to use for analysis purposes such as parameter estimation based on patient data. Hence, there is a need for simpler yet biophysically accurate and mathematically tractable models to be used for personalized simulation of electrical activity in human atria. Kalman filter, using the principle of recursive least square estimation, is a powerful tool for optimal estimation of states under different noise definitions. Model parameters can be augmented as state variables and can be estimated by Kalman filter. Kalman filter is also applicable for nonlinear systems with some modifications. One such widely use variant is extended Kalman filter (EKF). In this study, we propose a method for parameter estimation of a phenomenological cardiac model to match a targeted behavior first generated from a complex model, by using extended Kalman filter.

In order to reduce computer execution time and in the same time maintain the ability of the model to evaluate the scheduling rules correctly, a model reduction method based on selective clustering ensemble algorithm (SCEA) and Theory of Constraints (TOC) is proposed. Firstly, SCEA is adopted to identify the unimportant machines steadily, in which multiple base clusterings (BCs) are trained by k-means with different initial cluster centers and then are combined into a final result based on selective weight-voting strategy. Secondly, unimportant machines are removed from the detailed model, since such machines may not significantly affect the performance of the system, according to TOC. Thirdly, closed-loop correction structure is built to ensure the robustness of the reduced model. Finally, the reduced simulation model is used to evaluate the dispatching rules respectively with the scheduling objective of on-time delivery (OTD) rate, mean cycle time (MCT) and throughput.

One of the major concerns about a BEV battery pack is the process of aging, and the loss of driving range over the years of utilization. The phenomenon of capacity loss of lithium-ion batteries has been under scientific investigation for many years. Meanwhile, it is commonly accepted that the effects of temperature play an important role in this context [1-6]. Moreover, among others, the dynamic temperature behavior dictates the performance of the battery pack. The dimensioning of the cooling plays an important role in this manner [7]. In the early concept phase of a BEV and in this case the battery pack, many decisions must be made which have a major influence on the aforementioned aspects. Normally, simulation models are created to answer essential initial questions and to assist the cell selection process, as well as more general conceptual questions regarding the whole battery pack. More complex simulation models like 3D electrochemical or electrothermal finite element models require a great deal of computational power, especially when transient simulations are needed to answer important questions [8]. Therefore, a method is developed, which can speed up those simulations by a factor of more than 1,000 without losing to much accuracy of result. By creating metamodels with standardized pre-simulations of the models, the dynamic behavior can be emulated. It is shown, that by evaluating these meta-models in sequence, transient simulations can be executed without the time-consuming solving process of finite element models. Hence, it is possible to investigate a multitude of possible configurations in a much shorter and less computational expensive way.","","978-1-5090-3953-1","10.1109/ITEC.2017.7993294","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7993294","lithium;ion;battery;meta-model;simulation;transient;optimization;cell size;thermal","Batteries;Computational modeling;Optimization;Load modeling;Temperature measurement;Shape;Transient analysis","ageing;battery powered vehicles;finite element analysis;lithium compounds;optimisation;secondary cells;thermal analysis","rapid meta-model;transient thermal simulation;lithium ion battery cells;battery electric vehicles;BEV battery pack;dynamic temperature behavior;cell selection process;3D electrochemical finite element models;electrothermal finite element models","","","","24","","27 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Abstraction refinement iteratively constructs a simplified model to verify the original model. While a simplified model mitigates the weakness of model checking, the set of simplified error traces model helps guide simulation toward deep bugs. In abstraction refinement, concretization-a process of deriving an error trace in the original model from the abstract ones-is used to invalidate spurious abstract error traces or to refute a property.

In fact, the problems raised by the accumulation of data (storage, processing time, heterogeneity, capture rate/generation, etc.) become stronger because the data are massive, complex and varied. It is clear that the representation of information has the capacity to synthesize and condense data, and constitutes an efficient approach for analysis. Nevertheless, it remains ineffective and does not solve these problems. Besides that, conventional visualization techniques are rarely adapted to manage and process this mass of information. To face the complex big data challenges, various types of technologies have been developed. This paper talks about the visualization layer. This layer is located just above the Data Sources, Ingestion, Hadoop storage and Hadoop Platform Management layers for which we have already proposed a meta-modeling.

Simulation modeling is a common and well-accepted approach to study such systems, specially those that prove to be too complex to be analyzed by standard analytic methods. However, such urban simulation models can become computationally very expensive to run. To address this drawback, simulation metamodels can be employed to approximate the underlying simulation function. In this paper, we propose a batch-mode active learning strategy based on Gaussian Processes metamodeling that searches for the most informative data points in batches with respect to their corresponding predictive variances. These points are selected in such a way that they originate from different high variance neighborhoods. Eventually, this allows us to analyze the simulation output behavior with fewer simulation requests. Using an illustrative traffic simulation example, the results show that the proposed restricted batch-mode strategy is able to increase the simulation input space exploration efficiency in comparison with standard batch-mode strategies.","2161-4407","978-1-5090-6014-6","10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489302","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8489302","Active Learning;Gaussian Processes;Simulation Metamodeling;Traffic Simulation","Computational modeling;Metamodeling;Analytical models;Context modeling;Predictive models;Data models;Training","digital simulation;Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);traffic engineering computing","urban environments;urban simulation models;simulation metamodels;batch-mode active learning strategy;Gaussian Processes metamodeling;informative data points;restricted batch-mode strategy;simulation input space exploration efficiency;standard batch-mode strategies;predictive variances;traffic simulation;traffic simulators","","","","43","","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At times, however, these simulations themselves have resulted in a waste of both time and money with regard to future simulation development. Current trends address this problem by promoting the development of simulation infrastructures that are scalable, portable, and interoperable over a variety of paradigms. These infrastructures, such as HLA and SPEEDES, address cost issues by providing simulation infrastructures that promote model reuse by managing model interactions across diverse paradigms, improving scenario development, and allowing for a scalable distributed simulation capability. While these modern simulation infrastructures address many cost-related issues, they do not fully address issues related to model reuse. Simulations that utilize model reuse may result in large complex system models comprised of a diverse set of subsystem component models covering varying amounts of detail and fidelity. Often, a complex simulation that reuses high fidelity subcomponent models may result in a more detailed system model than the simulation objective requires. Simulating such a system model results in a waste of simulation time with respect to addressing the simulation goals. These simulation costs, however, can be reduced through the use of abstract modeling techniques. Key issues in the abstraction process involve identifying the variables or parameters than can be abstracted away for a given simulation objective and applying the proper abstraction technique to replace those parameters. The paper presents approaches for both identifying and replacing these candidate variables.","","0-7803-6579-8","10.1109/WSC.2000.899735","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899735","","Computational modeling;Costs;Power system modeling;Weapons;Laboratories;Defense industry;Modems;Parameter estimation;Power engineering computing;Power generation","digital simulation;engineering computing;software reusability","abstract modeling;engagement level simulations;engineering level simulations;defense communities;industrial communities;simulation development;simulation infrastructures;HLA;SPEEDES;cost issues;model reuse;model interactions;scenario development;scalable distributed simulation capability;large complex system models;subsystem component models;complex simulation;high fidelity subcomponent models;simulation goals;simulation costs;abstraction process;simulation objective;candidate variables","","7","","20","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The focus of the current paper is to present an efficient simulation flow for prediction of three-dimensional temperature fields at transient operating conditions with multiple heat sources and associated thermal cross talk at component and system levels. In what follows, we will demonstrate the virtual assembly of an electronic control unit (ECU) and its transient thermal simulation in time domain. We will decompose the unit into its major components for which fast mathematical models will be derived by means of model order reduction techniques. We will then create a reduced mathematical model of the entire ECU by simply interconnecting all component models at predetermined I/Os. We will demonstrate a stimulus-response analysis of the interconnected system and a subsequent result expansion path for 3-D visualization of temperature fields.

Moreover, since the range of required view types is continuously evolving, it must be possible to extend and enhance the languages and services offered by such tools on an ongoing basis. However, this can be difficult with today's modeling tools because the meta-models that define the languages, views and services they support are usually hardwired and thus not amenable to extension. In practice, therefore, various workarounds have to be used to extend a tool's underlying meta-model. Some of these are built into the implemented modeling standards (e.g. the UML profile, BPMN 2.0 and ArchiMate 2.0 extension mechanisms) while others have to be applied by complementary, external tools (e.g. model weaving). These techniques not only increase accidental complexity, they also reduce the ability of the modeling tool to ensure adherence to enterprise rules and constraints.

It hides the complexity of the model from the system designer and allows to configure parameters and analyze results in one single application.

In such systems, for example required in network and image processing applications, the different ICs (e.g. processors and memories) are placed on a silicon interposer, which allow shorter interconnect lines between the elements, improving the signal transmission. The example system used throughout this paper combines an ASIC for signal processing with a high-performance memory. These two chips are placed as bare dies side-by-side on a silicon interposer using copper pillars. The interposer itself is located on a PCB. The good thermal conductivity of the copper structures within the interposer (i.e., top and bottom metal layers and the through-silicon-vias), in combination with the copper pillars underneath the dies, enable a high-performance and effective thermal behavior of the system; the heat produced by the processor and memory dies is dissipated through these elements to the PCB substrate that supports the system. However, in complex microelectronic systems that include arrays of different metal layers, TSVs, copper pillars, solder balls etc., their modeling and simulation can be an expensive procedure. This is especially a problem in early design phases where many different technologies options (e.g., packaging variants) have to be evaluated. Moreover, a real design exploration can be time consuming in many cases. In order to simplify the modeling procedure and speed up simulation, we present an alternative approach to derive simulation models from system descriptions, reduce the simulation time, and ensure the reliability of the obtained results. The array of copper pillars of the system is substituted with simplified blocks with the same volume and material properties. In terms of simulation, the meshing of cuboids and rectangular blocks is easier than meshing cylinders or spheres. The simulation time of the simplified model can be significantly reduced. First simplifications already result in 10-15% shorter simulation time (down to 2 mins reduction). The obtained numerical results are similar to the ones extracted prior to the aforementioned simplifications; the value deviation ranged between 1.5-3% for simulation cases up to 10 W applied power. However, the possible degree of simplification is strongly dependent on the application specific boundary conditions. As an example, for high-power applications; by further increasing the applied power, larger deviations can be observed (up to 7.8% for 25 W power, according to our simulation). Additionally, we propose an efficient solution in order to simulate the hot-spots inside the dies; they are performing complex and high-speed functions that result in heat concentration at specific points of the IC. Finally, another important parameter examined is the influence of the thermal interface material (TIM) in the behavior of the system with respect to the heat dissipated through the system if a heat-sink is included in the model.","1087-9870","978-1-4673-8121-5","10.1109/ITHERM.2016.7517555","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7517555","high-speed dies;interposer;heat-sink;thermal behavior;heat distribution;power dissipation;thermal interface materials;copper pillars;thermal conductivity","Heating;Copper;Program processors;Substrates;Silicon;Integrated circuit modeling;Thermal conductivity","application specific integrated circuits;copper;elemental semiconductors;heat sinks;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit modelling;integrated memory circuits;materials properties;microprocessor chips;printed circuits;signal processing;silicon;solders;thermal analysis;thermal conductivity;three-dimensional integrated circuits","TIM;heat-sink;thermal interface material;heat concentration;meshing cylinders;material properties;solder balls;PCB substrate;memory dies;processor dies;TSV;through-silicon-vias;thermal conductivity;copper pillars;high-performance memory;signal processing;ASIC;signal transmission;interconnect lines;silicon interposer;image processing applications;3D system integration;2.5 system integration;interposer-solution;microelectronic systems;thermal simulation","","1","","14","","21 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These rules are used by a simplification algorithm, which is embedded in a control loop of complexity measurement and behavior measurement.","1558-4305","978-1-4244-5771-7","10.1109/WSC.2009.5429707","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5429707","","Computational modeling;Runtime;Discrete event simulation;Fluid flow measurement;Size measurement;Electrostatic precipitators;Computer integrated manufacturing;Automatic control;Size control;Application software","compensation;computational complexity;discrete event simulation;materials requirements planning","controlled simplification;material flow simulation models;behavioral deviation;model component classes;user-defined model;compensation;simplification rules;simplification techniques;simplification algorithm;control loop;complexity measurement;behavior measurement","","8","","14","","11 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The continuous approximation is used only do determine how the bottlenecks are fed. Different continuous model have been proposed in the past.

Unfortunately, its computational efficiency can be severely degraded for multiscale problems, where small and large features coexist. This scenario is common in signal and power integrity, because of the large aspect ratio of interconnects and power/ground planes. In this paper, we show how multiscale FDTD simulations can be accelerated with model order reduction. A detailed model for complex objects is first generated using a fine FDTD grid. The model is then compressed with model order reduction, and embedded into a main coarse grid. During this process, the stability limit of the reduced model can be also extended, enabling the use of a larger time step in the whole domain. Using a passivity argument, we are able to systematically guarantee the stability of the resulting scheme, which is a main novelty with respect to previous works. A numerical example with two reduced models shows the potential of the proposed ideas.","2165-4115","978-1-5090-6110-5","10.1109/EPEPS.2016.7835427","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7835427","Finite-Difference Time-Domain;Model Order Reduction;CFL Limit Extension;Stability","Finite difference methods;Time-domain analysis;Stability analysis;Power system stability;Numerical stability;Mathematical model;Computational modeling","computational electromagnetics;finite difference time-domain analysis;numerical stability;reduced order systems","multiscale FDTD simulations;model order reduction;FDTD grid;passivity argument;Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability limit;power-ground planes;computational efficiency;finite-difference time-domain method;CFL limit;provable stability;reduced order modeling","","2","","12","","30 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Development and evaluation of complex smart grid applications would benefit from efficient simulation environment. The traditional approach is to employ two simulators, one for communication and the other for power grid, nevertheless this approach would require coordination of multiple simulators, each having its own intrinsic timing and relationship attributes. In this paper we present an abstracted model-based approach that models and simulates communication and power systems within one simulator. We discuss the design and implementation of different components in this simulation environment. This way of implementation enables easy and rapid modeling, simulation and investigation of new methods and innovations of new smart grid applications.

Special purpose simulation (SPS) techniques have introduced computer modeling to the industry, resulting in reduced model development time and a user-friendly environment. This paper describes the special purpose simulation template, which is based on the tower crane operations performed by PCL Constructors Incorporated. On-site management of the tower crane resource is based on prioritized work tasks that need to be performed within a set period of time. Traditional SPS modeling techniques use 'relationship logic links' to represent the logic contained in the modeled system. As the number of work tasks increases for the tower crane resource, the model complexity using traditional simulation techniques becomes unmanageable, resulting in limited acceptance by industry practitioners. The tower crane template uses 'priority rating logic' to replace the 'relationship logic links'. Evaluation of the tower crane operations at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Research Facility (ECERF), being constructed in Edmonton, is used to illustrate the advantages of using the 'priority rating logic' modeling approach for tower crane operations. The simulation model analyzes the ECERF tower crane production cycle yielding outputs for total duration, crane utilization, and lift activity hook-time analysis.","","0-7803-7614-5","10.1109/WSC.2002.1166455","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1166455","","Poles and towers;Cranes;Computational modeling;Logic;Computer simulation;Computer industry;Resource management;Industrial relations;Analytical models;Production","digital simulation;construction industry;cranes;project management;structural engineering computing","special purpose simulation modeling;tower cranes;computer modeling;PCL Constructors Incorporated;on-site management;priority rating logic;Electrical and Computer Engineering Research Facility;ECERF;Edmonton;simulation model;production cycle;total duration;crane utilization;lift activity hook-time analysis","","3","","3","","22 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One approach to overcome this limitation is to develop a ""metamodel"". In other words, generate a ""surrogate"" model of the original system that accurately captures the relationships between input and output, yet is computationally more efficient than simulation. Neural networks (NN) are known to be good function approximators and thus make good metamodel candidates. During training, a NN is presented with several input/output pairs, and is expected to learn the functional relationship between inputs and outputs of the simulation model. So, a trained net can predict the output for inputs other than the ones presented during training. This ability of NNs to generalize depends on the number of training pairs used. In general, a large number of such pairs is required and, since they are obtained through simulation, the metamodel development is slow. In DES simulation it is often possible to use perturbation analysis to also obtain sensitivity information with respect to various input parameters. We investigate the use of sensitivity information to reduce the simulation effort required for training a NN metamodel.","","0-7803-6579-8","10.1109/WSC.2000.899736","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899736","","Discrete event systems;Neural networks;Computational modeling;Power system modeling;Discrete event simulation;Aerospace electronics;Least squares approximation;Command and control systems;Manufacturing;Power engineering and energy","discrete event simulation;neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence)","model abstraction;discrete event systems;neural networks;sensitivity information;complex systems;metamodel;surrogate model;function approximators;NN training;input/output pairs;functional relationship;training pairs;metamodel development;DES simulation;perturbation analysis;input parameters;simulation effort;NN metamodel","","8","","14","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to enhance the practicality of the models for the WWTP, a simplified model is developed based on the activated sludge model No. 1 (ASM1), which is the most widely studied model and published by the International Water Association (IWA). The simplified model is suitable for describing the process of carbon removal in the plug-flow activated sludge WWTP. It has a much simpler structure and less time cost in simulation. To validate the effectiveness fairly, the simplified model is applied based on the benchmark. The benchmark is a standard platform-independent simulation environment proposed by IWA defining a plant layout, a simulation model, influent data, test protocols and evaluation criteria. The simplified model replaces the ASM1 to describe the biological-chemical reactions of the reactors in the benchmark plant. The simulation result is closed to the test data using three different weather files and demonstrates the precision of the simplified model.","1934-1768","978-7-81124-055-9","10.1109/CHICC.2006.4347075","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4347075","Simplified model;Activated Sludge;wastewater treatment process;Benchmark;ASM1","Wastewater treatment;Biological system modeling;Application specific processors;Benchmark testing;Costs;Microorganisms;Biomass;Chemical processes;Automation;Protocols","chemical reactions;chemical reactors;sludge treatment;wastewater treatment","activated sludge wastewater treatment process;International Water Association;IWA;plug-flow activated sludge WWTP;biological-chemical reactions;benchmark plant reactors","","1","","6","","15 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SystemC facilitates development of Transaction-Level Models (TLMs)[2][3] for SoC components at higher level of abstraction than RTL. This enables lower modeling effort and higher simulation speeds. Memories and Memory Controllers play significant role in the SoC Architecture right from boot-up of the SoC to the regular functionalities. With the growing complexity of SoC Architecture, SoC comprises different kind of memories and Controllers. All though the access timing, electrical levels, technology, access commands are different for each of the memories, when it comes to simulation model features like electrical levels, technology used etc. are of no impact. If the Simulation abstraction is functional accurate type which is generally used for software development use-case, as the software has no idea on cycle information even the accuracy in memory access timings are not of much significance. Features like interface & interface protocols between controller and memories, state machine synchronization, commands and formats for page programming, page reading, block erasing, pipeline accessing, parameter page reading, error control correction etc. are to be implemented functionally accurate. Considering the increasing number of features and complexity of the Flash Memories and Memory Controllers, the effort involved in developing SystemC TLM models for these is significant and many a time repetitive across different memory models and controllers. One of the challenges in this project is to come up with design solutions for implementing Flash Memories and Memory Controllers which would reduce model development efforts and afford reusability, and secondly to improve the memory accessing time of the implemented memories which in turn to improve simulation speeds a buy-in factor for the customers/simulation users.","","978-1-4799-3358-7","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950127","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950127","Memory Controller Model;Memory Model;Simulation;SoC;SystemC;Virtual Platforms","Hardware;Timing;Software;Testing;Time-varying systems;Time-domain analysis;Accuracy","flash memories;hardware description languages;memory architecture;paged storage;system-on-chip","memory controllers;virtual platform;SystemC simulations;system on chip;hardware availability;transaction-level models;SoC components;SoC architecture;regular functionalities;electrical levels;access commands;simulation abstraction;software development use-case;memory access timings;interface & interface protocols;state machine synchronization;page programming;block erasing;pipeline accessing;parameter page reading;error control correction;flash memories;SystemC TLM models;memory models;memory accessing time","","1","","14","","10 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They have tried to predict the weather, cure disease and interact with society, even in the most primitive of times. This talk argues that we (humans) have approached complex systems using a standard approach, utilizing the following steps: (1) collect data from (make observations of) the system, (2) create some useful abstractions of some features of the system, (3) develop a model of the system, and (4) use this model to try to predict future behavior of the system. Today, analysts use simulation models in exactly the same way. We observe the system, develop some abstractions, and then construct a simulation of the system. We then we use this model to make predictions about the future behavior of the system. The talk explores some earlier attempts at developing models. It then shows how simulation models are a natural outgrowth of these earlier models. The talk concludes with a discussion of tradeoffs associated with conducting systems analysis projects.

This paper suggests a graph-theoretic approach to measure the extent of conceptual congruity of models within a new context. The premise of the approach is based on having contextualized models that provide introspective access to their metamodels. A metamodel associated with a reusable model entails a conceptualization of the domain in which it is originally designed to be situated in. The metamodels are used to instantiate a metagraph and graph distance metrics are used to measure the alignment of metamodels in the context of the new application domain.","1558-4305","978-1-4244-1305-8","10.1109/WSC.2007.4419708","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4419708","","Ontologies;Context modeling;Computational modeling;Software measurement;Computer simulation;Computer science;Software engineering;Acoustical engineering;Assembly;Software maintenance","digital simulation;graph theory;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems","meta-level ontology relation;interoperability;simulation model;graph-theoretic approach;conceptual congruity model;metamodel;metagraph;graph distance metrics","","4","","18","","4 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To question whether and how reduced sialylation affects Nav activity and cardiac electrical signaling, we conducted a series of in vitro experiments on ventricular apex myocytes under two different glycosylation conditions, reduced protein sialylation (ST3Gal4-/-) and full glycosylation (control). Although aberrant electrical signaling is observed in reduced sialylation, realizing a better understanding of mechanistic details of pathological variations in INa and AP is difficult without performing in silico studies. However, computer model of Nav channels and cardiac myocytes involves greater levels of complexity, e.g., high-dimensional parameter space, nonlinear and nonconvex equations. Traditional linear and nonlinear optimization methods have encountered many difficulties for model calibration. This paper presents a new statistical metamodeling approach for efficient computer experiments and optimization of Nav models. First, we utilize a fractional factorial design to identify control variables from the large set of model parameters, thereby reducing the dimensionality of parametric space. Further, we develop the Gaussian process model as a surrogate of expensive and time-consuming computer models and then identify the next best design point that yields the maximal probability of improvement. This process iterates until convergence, and the performance is evaluated and validated with real-world experimental data. Experimental results show the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance in modeling the kinetics of Nav channels under a variety of glycosylation conditions. As a result, in silico models provide a better understanding of glyco-altered mechanistic details in state transitions and distributions of Nav channels. Notably, ST3Gal4-/- myocytes are shown to have higher probabilities accumulated in intermediate inactivation during the repolarization and yield a shorter refractory period than WTs. The proposed statistical design of computer experiments is generally extensible to many other disciplines that involve large-scale and computationally expensive models.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2015.2458791","National Science Foundation; American Heart Association; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164191","Cardiac myocytes;design of computer experiments;Gaussian process;simulation model;sodium channel;space filling design;statistical metamodel","Computational modeling;Computers;Data models;Mathematical model;Metamodeling;Algorithm design and analysis;Predictive models","bioelectric phenomena;biomembrane transport;cardiology;cellular biophysics;design of experiments;Gaussian processes;sodium;statistical analysis","statistical metamodeling;cardiac electrical signaling;ventricular apex myocytes;glycosylation conditions;fractional factorial design;Gaussian process model;sequential design of computer experiments;sodium channel;cardiac myocytes","Animals;Computational Biology;Glycosylation;Humans;Markov Chains;Models, Theoretical;Myocytes, Cardiac;Sodium Channels","11","","35","","22 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A previously proposed framework is able to dynamically combine submodels of three model families (respiratory mechanics, gas exchange and cardiovascular dynamics) to form a complex, interacting model system. When concurrent computation of the combined submodels is employed, tests exhibited high computing costs. Therefore, a sequential computing approach is introduced. Thereby, direct interaction between the submodels is not applicable as all submodels are computed individually. To simulate submodel interaction, interface signals that are normally present in the concurrent approach were precalculated using reduced models of respiratory mechanics and cardiovascular dynamics. Evaluation of the new approach showed that results feature a discrepancy lower than 2.5% compared to the results computed by the concurrent approach. Simulation error could be decreased to 2% by improving the precalculation of the interface signals.

This toolkit is designed to work with the simulation system ""simcron MODELLER"" and will be used to handle typical optimization tasks like the weekly demand plan of a back-end process or optimal batch sizes for burn-in ovens. It is suitable for educational purposes too, and we are using it in practical courses where students learn more about factory scheduling.

Simulation techniques are often incorporated in the performance analysis of these systems. Simulation models enable an operating system to be represented in detail, e.g., multitasking, message handling, and concurrent processing. This level of detail is useful in evaluating software design. However, the complexity of such models can lead to costly simulations. Aggregation techniques can often be used to reduce model complexity. Aggregation typically involves the representation of only part of the system in detail, i.e., the primary subsystem. The remainder of the system is represented by a simplified composite. Parametric analysis is performed on the primary subsystem. The role of the composite is to introduce interactive effects to the primary subsystem. Aggregation techniques are accurate for certain classes of analytic models. The purpose of this study is to apply aggregation to the simulation model of a multiprocessor switching system. A model for real-time performance evaluation is described. An aggregation technique is derived from basic queueing models. The accuracy of the aggregated model is assessed through the simulation of realistic test cases. The results demonstrate that good accuracy can be obtained with aggregation.

For the purposes of refining domain abstraction, reducing composition complexity, or improving model execution, these CCA may first be composed with each other to reduce the number of CCA models. A modeler must understand the impact that disparities between CCA may have on the potential composition. To that end, this paper builds upon the original publication to describe closure properties of formal composition of CCA with respect to their dimensional attributes-cell indices and time.

Nevertheless, MDD approaches have not been widely adopted in practice mainly due to the difficulty and high initial cost of switching the development paradigm from code-centric to model-driven. This work presents a systematic method for reverse engineering abstract models from embedded codes using the notion of abstract components which act as independent units of development, validation, and verification. The recursive reverse engineering process constructs high-level abstract components from low-level ones using synchronized abstraction and projection abstraction, defined w.r.t. the information on port dependency and port bindings. This approach is demonstrated with reverse-engineered TinyOS, where each abstract component is validated and verified using model simulation and model checking.","1530-2059","978-1-4244-9091-2","10.1109/HASE.2010.20","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5634316","Reverse-engineering;component;abstraction","Synchronization;Reverse engineering;Radiation detectors;Systematics;Switches;Embedded systems;Manuals","embedded systems;program verification;reverse engineering;safety-critical software","reverse engineering;high-level abstract component;model-based development;embedded software verification;MDD;safety-critical embedded system;synchronized abstraction;projection abstraction;TinyOS;model simulation;model checking","","","","28","","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the complexity of their model, it does not give a readily usable mathematical expression for the V-ATPase current. Based on their analysis of the structure of the proton pump, we develop a two-compartment model of the V-ATPase, which contains a membrane ""half-channel"" for proton translocation separated by a hydrophilic strip and a hydrophobic wall from the cytoplasm. Using the Langevin equation to describe proton transport across the membrane, we simplify the model based on their assumptions on the molecular structure of the pump and arrive at a general form of solution to the proton pump flux driven by ATP hydrolysis based on assumptions on the physiological properties of the strip and the wall, as well as the two fluid compartments. In this process of simplification, we explicitly relate V-ATPase structure, stoichiometry, pump efficiency, and ATP hydrolysis energy to the active pump current. The simplified model is used to provide model-generated approximations to measured data from a variety of laboratories. In addition, it provides a very compact characterization of V-ATPase, which can be used as a proton extruder in a variety of different cell membranes, as well as in the membranes of intracellular organelles.","1558-2639","","10.1109/TNB.2004.837905","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1363984","Electrophysiology;mechanochemstry;molecular motors;proton extrusion","Protons;Couplings;Rotors;Plasma measurements;Biomembranes;Stators;Torque;Extracellular;Micromotors;Biochemistry","physiological models;biomembrane transport;bioelectric phenomena;proteins;molecular biophysics;biochemistry","V-ATPase H/sup +/ extrusion;V-type H/sup +/-translocating ATPase;mechanochemical model;proton pump;two-compartment V-ATPase model;membrane half-channel;proton translocation;cytoplasm;Langevin equation;pump molecular structure;ATP hydrolysis;active pump current;cell membranes;intracellular organelles;H","Biological Transport, Active;Computer Simulation;Models, Biological;Models, Chemical;Molecular Motor Proteins;Molecular Motor Proteins;Proton Pumps;Proton Pumps;Protons;Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases;Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases","3","","14","","6 Dec 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unifying models of multi-domain physical phenomena and processes, and man-made artifacts into a single modeling substrate will enable enhanced design of intelligent control algorithms and analytics. Moreover, with use of known modeling abstractions, which describe the physical ordinary differential equation (ODE) relationships by introducing model components, such as those found in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools, models of the physical world, e.g. irrigation systems, integrated with models of cyber world, e.g. electrical circuits, can be analyzed using existing tools. This can be done by using analogies between hydraulic, electrical, mechanical, etc. For example, we developed soil moisture transient electrical circuit model for the next generation of Irrigation CPS. The most important component in smart irrigation system design are the knowledge of water transport in the soil, or percolation, and water uptake by plants or transpiration and evaporation, or combined evapotranspiration (ET). Main analytical ODEs that describe water transport in soil are Richard's Equation: ∂θ/∂t =(∂θ/∂z) [K(θ)(( ∂ψ/∂z) + 1)] and Darcy's Law: q = K(ψ)∇ψ, where θ is water content, K is the hydraulic conductivity, z is the elevation, t is time, ψ is the pressure head or water potential, q is the flux or the discharge per square area. However, these equations do not have closed form solutions, thus, we chose to model and simulate the phenomena using electrical circuit components. To expose the underlying soil physics, we modeled vertical segment of soil by layers of water storage, or capacitive, and transport, or resistive, components. Starting with a single layer of storage, model is tuned and evolved. At each successful stage of evolution, a storage component is divided into two storage elements and connected by a transport component. Meanwhile, model parameters are tuned by quadratic optimization with respect to experimental data split into training and validation segments, which were gathered from outdoor soil moisture sensor in a 16 day duration with 15 min sampling period. Finally, experimental results show that model order 3 has the best fit of experimental data with R2 = 0.923. Thus, this ODE based simulation methodology describes transient behavior of vertical moisture transport in soil, and enables CPS model- based design and control.","","978-1-5090-1772-0","10.1109/ICCPS.2016.7479116","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7479116","","Mathematical model;Analytical models;Irrigation;Substrates;Soil moisture;Transient analysis","cyber-physical systems;irrigation;water storage","modeling substrate;irrigation cyber-physical systems;CPS multidomain nature;compartmentalized;complex system simulation models;multidomain physical phenomena;man-made artifacts;intelligent control algorithms;physical ordinary differential equation;ODE relationships;model components;electronic design automation;EDA tools;soil moisture transient electrical circuit model;irrigation CPS;smart irrigation system design;water transport;percolation;water uptake;evapotranspiration;ET;Darcy law;water content;hydraulic conductivity;electrical circuit components;water storage","","1","","","","26 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In control room of complex systems and under high task load situations, teams of operators are solely responsible for the ultimate decision making and control; but incomplete information, little time, stressful conditions and lack of mutual awareness can lead to critical human errors and the aggregate impact of such errors inside communication loops can give rise to complicated failure modes. This research develops a method to explicitly model the operating crew as an interactive social unit and investigates the dynamic behavior of the team under upset situations through a simulation method. The ultimate goal is to study the effects of team factors and team dynamics on the risk of the complex system with the main focus being on team errors, associated causes and error management inside the team and the impact of such factors on team performance. Information sharing, distribution, and collection, building of shared mental models, team decision making and combined action execution by the operating crew are being systematically modeled and examined. An object based modeling methodology is applied to represent system elements and different roles and behaviors of the members of the operating team. The proposed team model is an extended version of an existing cognitive model of individual operator behavior known as IDAC (Information, Decision, and Action in Crew context) (Chang et al, 2007). Scenario generation follows typical DPRA (Dynamic Probabilistic Risk Assessment) methodologies. The method capabilities are demonstrated through building and simulating a simplified model of a steam/power generating plant. Different configurations of team characteristics and influencing factors have been simulated and the performance is compared based on observing parameters of interest. These parameters include the quality of leadership, the quality of verbal and device-based communications from both individual and team perspectives, various team and organizational factors and the individual characteristics of each of operators. The mechanism of effect of each major category of contributing factors has been modeled and causal maps were developed to calculate the probability of failure of basic human functions dynamically and by using a number of lower level influencing factors driven from the existing literature. The effects of team factors and team dynamics on system risk and their impact on team performance have been studied through large number of simulation runs. The results are also compared with several theoretical models and empirical studies. As part of the analysis, the contributing factors have been modified over their qualitative spectrum, from one extreme level to another in order to see if the model generates intuitively anticipated results. We also developed CREWSIM, a customized library in MATLAB Simulink environment which facilitates the modeling process for similar applications of the methodology.","0149-144X","978-1-4799-2848-4","10.1109/RAMS.2014.6798446","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798446","Human Reliability;Object-based Modeling;Simulation;Dynamic PRA","Mathematical model;Data models;Context modeling;Load modeling;Context;Reliability;Predictive models","business data processing;decision making;digital simulation;failure analysis;human factors;human resource management;object-oriented methods;risk management;team working","operating crew dynamic behavior;complex systems control room;team working;interpersonal coordination;supervision;task management;operating teams;human errors;interactive social unit;team factors;team dynamics;team errors;error management;team performance;information sharing;information distribution;information collection;shared mental model building;team decision making;object based modeling;individual operator behavior cognitive model;IDAC;information-decision-action in crew context;dynamic probabilistic risk assessment;steam generating plant model;power generating plant model;leadership quality;verbal communications quality;device-based communications quality;organizational factors;causal maps;human function failure probability;system risk;qualitative spectrum;CREWSIM;MATLAB Simulink","","","","15","","17 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through this approach, analysts can leverage validated metamodels to map system measures, from component level MOPs to the overall system FOM in real-time to support decisions under constrained time-frames. Through metamodeling we achieve approximations of the simulation model in mathematical form, which alleviates long run times and the need for large computational resources.

We propose a new high-level (abstracted) physiologically-based computational heart model that is time-critical and dynamic. Methods: The model comprises cardiac regional cellular-electrophysiology types connected by a path model along a conduction network. The regional electrophysiology and paths are modeled with hybrid automata that capture non-linear dynamics, such as action potential and conduction velocity restitution and overdrive suppression. The hierarchy of pacemaker functions is incorporated to generate sinus rhythms, while abnormal automaticity can be introduced to form a variety of arrhythmias such as escape ectopic rhythms. Model parameters are calibrated using experimental data and prior model simulations. Conclusion: Regional electrophysiology and paths in the model match human action potentials, dynamic behavior, and cardiac activation sequences. Connected in closed loop with a pacing device in DDD mode, the model generates complex arrhythmia such as atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia. Such device-induced outcomes have been observed clinically and we can establish the key physiological features of the heart model that influence the device operation. Significance: These findings demonstrate how an abstract heart model can be used for device validation and to design personalized treatment.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2019.2917212","Faculty Research Development Fund; Fondation Leducq; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8716571","Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT);implantable cardiac device;  $in\; silico$   closed-loop validation;heart modeling;hybrid automaton","Biological system modeling;Pacemakers;Computational modeling;Action potentials;Avalanche photodiodes;Heart beat","bioelectric phenomena;bioelectric potentials;biomechanics;closed loop systems;diseases;electrocardiography;medical control systems;medical signal processing;pacemakers","cardiac electrical devices;in silico closed-loop testing;ectopic rhythms;conduction velocity restitution;action potential;nonlinear dynamics;electrophysiology;conduction network;cardiac regional cellular-electrophysiology types;computational heart model;time-critical requirements;time-critical cardiac device systems;biophysical computer models;closed-physiologic-loop;implantable devices;closed-loop validation;cardiac electrical modeling;heart model;device operation;pacing device;cardiac activation sequences;dynamic behavior;human action potentials","Action Potentials;Cardiac Electrophysiology;Computer Simulation;Humans;Models, Cardiovascular;Pacemaker, Artificial;Reproducibility of Results;Tachycardia, Atrioventricular Nodal Reentry","1","","51","IEEE","16 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a common engineering practice it is important to have a tool that simplifies the modeling of the salient features of a desired system. In electric micro-grids, these salient features are the voltage and power distributions within the micro-grid. Current simplified electric power grid simulator tools such as PowerWorld, PowerSim, Gridlab, etc, model only the power distribution features of a desired micro-grid. Other power grid simulators such as Simulink, Modelica, etc, use detailed Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) modeling to accommodate the voltage distribution features. This paper presents a SGridSim micro-grid simulator tool that simplifies the modeling of both the voltage and power distribution features in a desired micro-grid. The SGridSim tool accomplishes this simplified modeling by using Effective Node-to-Node Complex Impedance (EN2NCI) models of components that typically make-up a micro-grid. The term EN2NCI models means that the impedance based components of a micro-grid are modeled as single impedances tied between their respective voltage nodes on the micro-grid. The benefit of the presented SGridSim tool are 1) simulation of a micro-grid is performed strictly in the complex-domain; 2) faster simulation of a micro-grid by avoiding ODE solving. An example micro-grid model was built using the SGridSim tool and tested to simulate both the voltage and power distribution features with a total absolute relative error of less than 6%.","","978-1-4799-0503-4","10.1109/ISRCS.2013.6623761","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6623761","Computer aided modeling;Simulation;Electric power grids","Load modeling;Solid modeling;Mathematical model;Impedance;Generators;Power transmission lines;Voltage control","differential equations;multi-agent systems;power distribution;power grids;power system control","microgrid simulator tool;SGridSim;effective node-to-node complex impedance models;EN2NCI models;multiagent controllers;electric power grid simulator tools;voltage distribution;power distribution;ODE solving","","1","","20","","10 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For broadband noise control, subband structures have been adopted in these kinds of algorithms, where the full-band adaptive filter coefficients are obtained from subband filter coefficients with weight transformation. However, the usually used two-direction search method suffers from slow convergence if the secondary path phase is close to ±90°. To deal with this problem, a four-direction search method has been proposed in frequency domain, which is sometimes too complicated for practical applications. In this paper, a simplified algorithm is proposed to reduce the implementation complexity. In the proposed algorithm, the delay of the secondary path is estimated first, and then the estimated delay is used in the delay compensation to reduce the number of subbands. Two reference signals are generated in each subband and two update directions are used. Only one subband reference signal and one update direction are selected to approximate the phase response of the residual secondary path, and then the full-band adaptive controller coefficients are adjusted directly in time domain with them without the need of further weight transformation. Just like those existing subband algorithms, the simplified algorithm can obtain similar steady-state noise reduction performance as that of the FxLMS algorithm but without secondary path modeling. Simulations and experiments are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2016.2516439","National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC); ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7377065","Active noise control;adaptive controller;secondary path modeling;simplified subband algorithm;Active noise control (ANC);adaptive controller;secondary path modeling;simplified subband algorithm","Adaptive filters;Delays;Filtering algorithms;Adaptation models;Finite impulse response filters;Band-pass filters;Least squares approximations","active noise control;adaptive control;delays","subband ANC algorithm;delay compensation;phase response approximation;full-band adaptive controller coefficients;steady-state noise reduction performance;active noise control algorithms","","12","","27","","8 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to relieve the computational burden, manage the complexity in design processes, and achieve concurrent analysis and design, a complex system can oftentimes be decomposed into several subsystems with hierarchical relation according to their functional attributes, physical structures, or scale magnitudes etc., and each subsystem can be analyzed and designed independently. In addition, metamodeling techniques are widely used in hierarchical system design and analysis to replace the original time-consuming simulation models, like finite element simulation, molecular dynamics simulation etc., so as to future reduce computational burden. However, due to the limited sample points, metamodeling may contain predictive uncertainty at sites with no sample point. In order to investigate the impact of the metamodeling uncertainty on system performance in multi-level engineering system design, this paper proposes a metamodeling uncertainty quantification method for multi-level engineering system, and derives uncertainty of system performance as a function of metamodel uncertainties of subsystem models. Two numerical examples are used to examine the contribution of the uncertainty of subsystem metamodels to the uncertainty of top-level performance of studied systems.","","978-1-4799-1016-8","10.1109/QR2MSE.2013.6625621","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6625621","multi-level system;kriging model;metamodeling uncertainty;uncertainty quantification","Uncertainty;Metamodeling;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Predictive models;System analysis and design;Mathematical model","concurrent engineering;decision theory;design engineering;large-scale systems;systems analysis;uncertainty handling","subsystem models;system performance uncertainty;metamodeling uncertainty quantification method;predictive uncertainty;hierarchical system analysis;hierarchical system design;scale magnitudes;physical structures;functional attributes;concurrent design;concurrent analysis;design process complexity management;decision parameters;decision variables;complex system design;multilevel engineering system design","","1","","8","","10 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal is to develop such a catalogue system independent from an application domain for managing metadata and providing metainformation (metainfo) about computer-based models. Metainfo is by our view the logical conclusion of metadata. We address the construction of an ontology-based system from an application and architectural point of view. We explain why and how one should construct a RDF(S) based system for supporting collaboration via the Internet and intranets.

The library has a formal basis where all elements are well defined and lead in construction of analyzable models. The semantics of communication and computation are implemented by the library, which allows the designer to focus on specifying the pure functional aspects.

Second, the aggregator integrates the load information and performs ESS day-ahead scheduling considering demand response (DR) to minimize operating cost.

This is especially true at wavelengths that are comparable to the dimensions of the car, for example, at the FM wavelengths considered in this paper. In such cases, variations of the design/geometrical structure of the car can lead to significant changes of the surface currents on the car chassis, which then contribute differently to the far-field pattern. On the other hand, full- wave simulations of exact car models suffer from the challenges of large computational power and simulation time requirement due to the extremely large number of mesh cells. In lieu of this fact, this paper analyzes strategies that appear appropriate for complexity reduction of a high- complexity car model, while maintaining a sufficient degree of similarity between the far- field results of the original model and its reduced counterpart. This would ease the requirement for large computational power and simulation time. At the same time, the equivalent reduced model could be beneficially used for further electromagnetic studies of the car, or for designing new types of antennas properly integrated into the car.","","978-1-5090-5932-4","10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108214","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8108214","","Automobiles;Solid modeling;Antennas;Computational modeling;Gain;Analytical models;Automotive components","antenna radiation patterns;automobiles;automotive components;mesh generation;mobile antennas","complex electromagnetic interaction;car chassis;exact car models;simulation time requirement;high- complexity car model;car body modeling;automotive antennas;FM wavelengths;far-field pattern;computational power;complexity reduction;gain patterns","","","","10","","16 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To improve the real-time feasibility of MPC, a simplified macroscopic urban traffic model is developed. Two MPC controllers are built based on the simplified model and a more detailed model. Simulation results of the two controllers show that the online optimization time is reduced dramatically by applying the simplified model, only losing a limited amount of control effectiveness. Additional techniques, like applying a control time horizon and an aggregation scheme, are implemented to reduce the computational complexity further.

These show that, contrary to basic models of queuing theory, automatic assignment of patients to physicians at triage (multiple queues model) reduces patient length of stay compared to self-assignment of patients by physicians (single queue allocation). Rotational PPAR facilitates the triage nurses' decision making and ensures an equal distribution of the number of patients, but it may not offset the differences in patients' severity and care needs, which lead to physicians' workload imbalance.

In this paper, a new reduction method that preserves the model's nonlinear structure using the holomorphic embedding (HE) technique is proposed, to generate network reductions which are accurate over a broader range of operating conditions. When applied to the power-flow problem, simulation results show that the proposed method can significantly improve bus-voltage and branch-flow accuracy, matching the full-model power-flow solution exactly when moving along the so-called α line.

This paper investigates cellular automata (CA) based models for solving the scheduling problem. A standard genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to evolve appropriate CA rules, that is transition rules able to schedule parallel programs. We identified that the state-of-art CA-based schedulers suffer when trying to manage eight or more processors. This difficulty is mainly due to the severe increment in the rule space cardinality when the number of states per cell are increased to represent more processors. We propose a non-standard cellular automata model able to minimize this problem. A new definition of local neighborhood is proposed here, which is denominated as Mapping-Reduce. In addition, the transition rule related to the mapping-reduce neighborhood uses a nondeterministic output, which printed a stochastic characteristic for the new CA model. By using the new CA model we were able to simplify the complexity of the transition rules employed in the proposed CA-based scheduler model. Simulations based on the new model were carried out using a family of four parallel programs that solve equations by Gaussian elimination. Based on the experiments using 4, 8 and 16 processors, it was noted that the results of the CAbased scheduling approach were improved for architectures with a higher number of nodes. Moreover, the evolved rules had shown a better generalization ability when applied to schedule new parallel programs which is a critical point related to the main motivation for the employment of CA in scheduling.","","978-1-5386-2407-4","10.1109/BRACIS.2017.27","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8247039","Cellular Automata;Genetic Algorithm;Task Scheduling Problem","Processor scheduling;Program processors;Computer architecture;Lattices;Microprocessors;Automata","cellular automata;genetic algorithms;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;parallel programming;processor scheduling","stochastic cellular automata model;Reduce rule space cardinality applied;task scheduling;processors;parallel program tasks;multiprocessing system;cellular automata based models;scheduling problem;standard genetic algorithm;appropriate CA rules;state-of-art CA;nonstandard cellular automata model;Mapping-Reduce;neighborhood uses a nondeterministic output;stochastic characteristic;CA model;scheduler model;CAbased scheduling approach","","2","","21","","8 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These tasks could be underwater or deep sea observatories. Acoustic sensors (Hydrophones) are responsible to acquire the data underwater then transfer it to components/devices. Marine Observatory (MO) is the scenario of data exchanged between the different components/devices of the Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UW-ASNs). Hence, the MO infrastructure could be based on an (UW-ASNs). This observation should take into consideration the environmental constraints since it may require specific tools, materials and devices (marines cables, specific servers and routers, etc.). The logical and physical components that are used in these observatories supply interchange procedures between the various devices of the environment (Smart Sensors, Data Fusion Servers). These components provide new services due to the long period running of the network. In this paper, we present our extended MetaModel that is used to generate a new design tool (ArchiMO). Thus, we propose a mapping approach between the layers of the enterprise architecture standard. This approach throws instantly domain-specific concepts and constraints in layers on run-time design activity according to a satisfaction of a certain criteria/constraints. We illustrate our proposal with an underwater object localization example from the MO domain. Additionally, we generate the corresponding simulation code for a standard network simulator using our self-developed domain-specific model compiler. Our approach helps to manage the complexity, and to reduce the time of the entire development life cycle of an MO information system. It supplies in the MO context, a way to share the different viewpoints of the designers.","","978-0-9339-5743-5","10.23919/OCEANS.2015.7404633","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7404633","Smart Sensors;Data Fusion;ArchiMate;Enterprise Architecture;Meta-Model;Model Driven Engineers;Underwater Object Localization;Marine Observatory;Models;Simulation;Domain Specific Modeling Language","Design tools;Servers;Complexity theory;Observatories;Information systems;Software;Context","environmental monitoring (geophysics);hydrophones;oceanographic techniques;underwater acoustic communication;wireless sensor networks","marine observatory;MO information system;enterprise architecture;collaborative monitoring tasks;underwater observatories;deep sea observatories;acoustic sensors;hydrophones;underwater acoustic sensor networks;UW-ASN;MetaModel;ArchiMO design tool;underwater object localization;self-developed domain-specific model compiler","","","","41","","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Coming with the digitalization of the ships, the success of MBSE (Model-Based System Engineering) approach in software-intensive systems has led major industrial actors, of which Naval Group, to adopt MBSE for large scale projects. Nowadays industry has to go further, as more and more systems have interactions between each other in a systems-of-systems prospective, as well as MBSE is becoming more mature. One major challenge is to run an efficient system engineering process, because it will secure the following other phases of the product lifecycle. The system engineering system required for an Aircraft-carrier, frigates and submarines design and development involves numerous companies and teams, in several domains of expertise. The number and the complexity of the involved enabling systems are also important: requirement and quality management tools, modelling and simulation tools, 3D design tools, etc... The communications between those teams, as well as the interfaces between those tools, are key points for a good design phase. So this paper proposes to take an MBSE approach to enhance these communications during the engineering phases, and to enable this integration between the different enabling systems that supports the engineering process. Another advantage is to establish the numerical continuum between the several engineering levels, domains and data, and to enhance automation of this integration by using the power of the model-based standards and associated frameworks. The innovation comes from the idea of engineering a new enabling system, able to define the system engineering integrated toolchain, tailored for each complex socio-technical system engineering process, and that this engineering is not performed by tool vendor, but by the target program team. So to define this system, we have tried to apply the fundamental principles of system engineering, onto the engineering system it-self, within a model-based approach: (i) the specification first, by giving more details on the motivations, second by expressing a simple set of requirements, modelled in a set of functions; (ii) the enterprise architecture modelling through a set of artefacts representing the System Engineering meta-model, and a first level of allocation; (iii) At last, as an early validation phase, where the relevancy and benefits of this approach will be discussed.","","978-1-5386-4876-6","10.1109/SYSOSE.2018.8428769","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8428769","System Engineering;Systems-of-Systems;MBSE;SysML;BPMN;OSLC","Tools;Systems engineering and theory;Automation;Adaptation models;Production;Stakeholders;Quality management","formal specification;naval engineering;ships;software engineering;systems engineering","model-driven approach;system engineering system;MBSE approach;Model-Based System Engineering;software-intensive systems;systems-of-systems;efficient system engineering process;complex socio-technical system engineering process;System Engineering meta-model;simulation tools;Naval ships","","","","5","","9 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Kijima's first virtual age model is used to describe the imperfect repair process. Due to the complexity of the underlying assumptions of this model, we are unable to derive a closed-form equation for availability. Therefore, simulation modeling & analysis are used to evaluate equipment availability. Based on initial availability plots, a generic availability function is proposed. A 2/sup 3/ factorial experiment is performed to evaluate the accuracy of this model. The maximum absolute error between the simulation output, and the corresponding values of the availability function is 3.82%. This indicates that our proposed function provides a reasonable approximation of equipment availability, which simplifies meaningful analysis for the unit. Therefore, a method is defined for determining optimum equipment replacement intervals based on average cost. Next, meta-models are developed to convert equipment reliability & maintainability parameters into the coefficients of the availability model. We expand on our initial experiment using a circumscribed central composite experimental design. We evaluate the accuracy of the meta-models for the 15 experiments & 50 random experiments within the design space. For the 50 new experiments, we compare the replacement policy obtained from analysis of the meta-model to the policy obtained directly from the simulation output. The average increase in cost resulting from the sub-optimal replacement policy is only 0.10%. Therefore, we conclude that the meta-models are robust, and provide good estimates of the parameters of our proposed availability function. By doing this, we eliminate the need to perform simulation to obtain the parameters of the availability model.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2005.857633","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1546563","Availability;imperfect maintenance;replacement;virtual age","Availability;Cost function;Analytical models;Parameter estimation;Weibull distribution;Equations;Performance evaluation;Maintenance;Design for experiments;Robustness","reliability theory;maintenance engineering;costing","generic availability function;imperfect repair process;repairable equipment;Kijima's first virtual age model;closed-form equation;simulation modeling;costing;equipment reliability;maintainability parameter;sub-optimal replacement policy;robust metamodel","","45","","16","","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These severe conditions ultimately determine the design limits and must therefore be carefully investigated. The enhanced internal arc simulation model, presented in this paper, considers the impact of evaporation of different materials on gas properties and the pressure rise, as well as the dependence of released arc energy, thermal transfer and evaporation intensity on the state of gas. The experimental set-up and the test configuration, used to validate the calculation results, are evaluated and discussed.

In order to avoid such a situation, a new structure of sociotechnical systems integrating resilience processes as a key category of processes was proposed. In the meta-model that was built using the UML language, the role played by resilience processes in maintaining resources availability was highlighted. To better understand this role, system dynamics modeling has been adopted. Using the causal diagram that has been drawn up, three pillars of a resilience process, namely resistance, recovery and anticipation were highlighted. The notion of resilience as a capacity has also been introduced. The improvement of this latter is linked to the effectiveness of the intervention of the associated resilience processes. A classification of processes according to their association with well-established resilience processes was also proposed. It is a five-step resilience scale. Then, the quantitative aspect was studied by drawing up a stock-flow diagram. Finally, this model has been run based on a practical case.

Cable ships are distinguished by large cable sheaves for guiding cable over bow or stern or both. The movement of the cable and the influence of the cable tension on the movement of the cable laying ship are two key problems to be solved during the cable laying operation simulation. But in the process of cable mathematic model being established, too many factors bring great difficulties to the research of the cable modeling. It is necessary to reach a higher precision for the established model to ensure the cable tension in great practical value. Besides, a simplified model with less computing work and lower complexity is also needed to meet the requirement of computer real-time simulation. At first, it brings forward one easy and useful method to solve the problem of cable modeling. Linear and nonlinear methods are adopted separately to build up the underwater cable dynamic model. The analytical formula of the cable's shape is presented. The cable tension acting on the ship are also computed out under a given ship motion state. Then, a ship's model is established with a three degree-of-freedom including surge, heave and pitch, according to the cable laying operation based on some assumptions. And the cable ship mathematical models are established considering the cable tension on the relevant three degree-of-freedom. Further more, the cable model and the cable tension's influences on the ship movement are simulated in some computer test. Finally, through these simulation tests, the relations between the cable tension on the ship and ship speed, the cable tension and the cable laying velocity, the cable tension and the water depth are analyzed. Moreover, the concrete influences of the cable upon the ship at three degree-of-freedom motions are concluded.

The signal is received by an antenna array in a scenario with interference and multipath propagation. These two effects are generally the limiting error sources in most high-precision positioning applications. A new estimator of the code- and carrier-phases is derived by using a simplified signal model and the maximum likelihood (ML) principle. The simplified model consists essentially of gathering all signals, except for the direct one, in a component with unknown spatial correlation. The estimator exploits the knowledge of the direction-of-arrival of the direct signal and is much simpler than other estimators derived under more detailed signal models.

Firstly the mathematical model of velocity matching is presented, and the kalman filter and robust filter formulations are introduced. Then it analyses the observability of various states in velocity matching scheme. This paper mainly focuses on the misalignment estimated accuracy and convergence speed of the proposed algorithm. In order to validate the effect of the velocity matching algorithm, three-axis sway model simulation based on 10 dimensions states and 5 dimensions states is carried out. The results of simulation suggest that the estimating accuracy of kalman filter is equivalent with that of robust filter, but convergence rate of robust filter are much better than that of kalman filter.

Several risk assessment techniques are based on the subjective judgement of domain experts. Subjective risk assessment techniques are human-intensive and error-prone. Risk assessment should be based on product attributes that we can quantitatively measure using product metrics. This paper presents a methodology for risk assessment at the early stages of the development lifecycle, namely the architecture level. We describe a heuristic risk assessment methodology that is based on dynamic metrics obtained from UML specifications. The methodology uses dynamic complexity and dynamic coupling metrics to define complexity factors for the architecture elements (components and connectors). Severity analysis is performed using FMEA (failure mode and effect analysis), as applied to architecture simulation models. We combine severity and complexity factors to develop heuristic risk factors for the architecture components and connectors. Based on component dependency graphs that were developed earlier for reliability analysis, and using analysis scenarios, we develop a risk assessment model and a risk analysis algorithm that aggregates the risk factors of components and connectors to the architectural level. We show how to analyze the overall risk factor of the architecture as the function of the risk factors of its constituting components and connectors.

Some academic and industrial frameworks are available to support bus-based MPSoCs, but few works target NoCs as underlying communication architecture. A framework targeting MPSoC customization must provide abstract models to enable fast design space exploration, flexible application mapping strategies, all coupled to features to evaluate the performance of running applications. This paper proposes a framework to customize NoC-based MPSoCs with support to static and dynamic task mapping and C/SystemC simulation models for processors and memories. A simple, specifically designed microkernel executes in each processor, enabling multitasking at the processor level. Graphical tools enable debug and system verification, individualizing data for each task.

"Modeling of Conducted Emission in ASD","J. Luszcz",NA,"High Frequency Conducted Emission in AC Motor Drives Fed By Frequency Converters: Sources and Propagation Paths","","2018","","","101","136","The primary objective of computational modeling of applications with power electronics converters is to obtain as many functionally essential characteristics of evaluated construction as possible without the necessity to build a prototype. Designing processes of power electronics converters are usually preceded by in‐depth simulation analysis of fundamental behavior which allows to predict most of the significant issues related to fundamental behavior before building physical model, but very rarely allow to solve problems related to EMC performance entirely effectively. In commonly used design process of ASD applications conducted emission issues are usually addressed after systems installation. Adding extra components for limiting conducted emission at this stage, very often significantly affects costs and completion time, or even requires redesigning of entire system. Therefore methodologies that allow to predict the EMC problems as early as possible are developed very extensively.Effectiveness of currently available simulation tools used for power electronics converters design is systematically increasing and nowadays is quite satisfactory for assessing fundamental functionalities of converters related to the used modulation methodologies. Nevertheless, detailed analysis of transistor's and diodes commutation processes usually require consideration of parameters of parasitic couplings existing internally in power electronic components and also resulting from externally connected sub‐components of ASDs, that significantly limit reliability of obtained results.Commonly, even in regular analysis of power electronic converters, extension of frequency bandwidth above few hundreds of kHz results in significant increase of influence of parasitic couplings, that cannot be omitted. Analysis of EMC behavior of FC extends model complexity excessively because it requires taking capacitive couplings to ground into account which are essential for conducted emission phenomena analysis. Parasitic couplings between energized and grounded components of converters are omnipresent, numerous and distributed in all sub‐components, including non‐electrical conducting construction.Complexity of analysis of conducted emission in ASDs is even higher, because ASDs in addition to FCs, include external and usually significantly changeable loads. The motor as a converter load is a relatively bulky component with long windings wires and grounded stator placed closely to each other, thus resulting in strong capacitive couplings to ground. The motor feeding cable is often of a considerable length with relation to the converter and motor dimensions and can be variantly placed in relation to other cabling ‐ especially grounded cable trays. Therefore a kind of the motor cable, cable shielding if exists and cable arrangement in particular application can influence significantly the overall EMC performance of the whole ASD application.Modeling of EMC behavior of an ASD as the whole system, consisting of a FC, an AC motor, the motor feeding cable and optionally EMI filtering components, requires knowledge of broadband characteristics of all sub‐components. Most of technical specifications of commonly used ASDs sub‐components currently provided by manufactures primarily do not include wide‐band specifications that are detailed enough for simulation analysis, even necessary within the conducted emission frequency range. Therefore modeling of EMC requires to determine missing parameters that describe broadband behavior of all sub‐components. Identification of all those missing parameters can be carried out in two ways: by measurement with the use of external terminals only or with intrusion into the inside of components. Both of the methods are problematic. Terminal based approach is much easier to run experimentally but allows to acquire only strongly limited information about internal structures of identified components. On the other hand, access to internal parts of identified components is much more elaborate and hazardous for tested devices, thus not always possible, however it can be very significant for effectiveness of model simplification.Summarizing, EMC analysis of ASDs is much more extensive, complex and challenging compared to the FC as one of the ASD component. Detailed investigation of the influence of all parasitic couplings existing in ASD leads to enormous expansion of model complexity, thus consequently greatly increases computational overhead and efforts necessary for identification process of numerous parameters of such models. The use of very extensive models usually also rises uncertainty about the accuracy of obtained results, therefore reasonable optimization and simplification of models is one the most expected outcomes of current developments in EMC analysis. In spite of many difficulties modeling simulation study of conducted emission in ASDs is increasingly intensively developed over the last years. In a number of published papers new methodologies for precise and successful solving of particular EMC issues occurring in contemporary applications of ASDs have been reported. Nevertheless maintaining reasonable balance between model complexity and its effectiveness is still the greatest challenge in current research areas related to EMC.","","9781119388951","10.1002/9781119388975.ch5","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8390833.pdf&bkn=8390733&pdfType=chapter","","Couplings;AC motors;Variable speed drives;Electromagnetic compatibility;Computational modeling;Cable shielding;Analytical models","","","","","","","","25 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

Firstly, cosimulation models of static electric field, eddy current and dynamic fluid were established. Then using the Latin hypercube sampling method, 50 samples were extracted from the optimized sample space, and the sensitivity analysis was performed based on the results of co-simulation model. Based on the sensitivity analysis results, the simplified model was established by using the least squares fitting method. The simplified model results are verified by co-simulation model. The results showed that calculation consistency of simplified model with co-simulation model is about 98.9%, while the computational efficiency of the simplified model is 4000 times that of the co-simulation model.

This poses new challenges for modelling, simulation, optimal design of systems containing mechanical and electrical components, including many switching power electronic converters. The generalized gyrator theory and time-domain transfer function theory provide new tools for studying the dynamics and stability of such electromechanical systems. This paper presents these concepts to help with the analysis, design and control of the more electric aircraft. Using the generalized gyrator theory, the mechanical components can be transferred to the electrical side of the system and representedby their electrical models. The time-domain transfer function theory of power electronics provides a method to model switching power electronics converters as a generalized transformer. This allows for the referral of circuit elements from one side of the switching converter to the other. As a result, the complex aircraft electromechanical system can be reduced to an electrical circuit simplified model. This will assist in the detailed analysis, design and control of the system, prior to physical prototyping (iron-bird). In addition, the overall system circuit model will provide a better insight into the operation and interactions between the components of the system.

Hussain","Aalborg University Esbjerg, Denmark","The Second International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES'07)","23 Apr 2007","2007","","","480","492","Social network analysis has been used for quite some time to analyze and understand the behavior of nodes in the network. Theses nodes could be individuals or group of persons, events or organizations, etc. In fact these nodes could be any thing, importantly, these nodes propagate or do some thing and obviously these nodes have attributes. Social network analysis (SNA) is a multi-model multi-link problem and one can imagine the challenge posed by such multidimensional task. Typically, models represent various processes and their organization including the interaction between processes. Such types of models are intellective simulation models, explaining one particular aspect of the model abstracting other factors present in the model. The standard or normal representation of a typical social network model is through a graph data structure. The dynamics of larger social networks is so complex some time it becomes difficult to understand the various levels of interactions and dependencies just by mere representation through a graph. However, to overcome this limitation many analytical methods provide relationship dependencies, role of different nodes and their importance in the social networks. Since the start of the new century many terrorism events have occurred around the globe. These events have provided a new impetus for the analysis, investigation, studying the behavior and tracking terrorist networks (individuals). In this paper we are presenting a very novel and absolutely new approach to SNA for locating important key players in the network. The system also predicts a path through these nodes which shows the vulnerability of the network and if the path along with these nodes is removed it can reduce/destabilize or even destroy the structure of the network","","0-7695-2775-2","10.1109/ARES.2007.146","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4159839","","Social network services;Information analysis;Information security;Visualization;Sociotechnical systems;Computer security;Computer science;Image analysis;Multidimensional systems;Data structures","graph theory;social sciences computing;terrorism","terrorist network analysis;argument driven hypotheses model;social network analysis;network node behavior;multimodel multilink problem;graph data structure;terrorism","","7","","31","","23 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the traditional TWIP robot can not keep upright when climbs or descends on a slope, which makes the operator sitting on the robot feel unsafe and uncomfortable. This paper introduces a Multi-DOF TWIP robot, which adding a movable weight to the standard TWIP robot. This robot can maintain the robot body upright when the robot climbs or descends a slope, also when accelerate or decelerate. The complex full dynamics model of the robot is derived from the Largrange's method, and then a simplified method is proposed. Controllers for balance and velocity control are designed separately based on the simplified model. Simulation and real experiment demonstrates that this method proposed in this paper is effective.","","978-1-4799-7397-2","10.1109/ROBIO.2014.7090623","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7090623","","Mobile robots;Wheels;Mathematical model;Robot kinematics;Dynamics;Friction","mobile robots;motion control;multi-robot systems;nonlinear control systems;pendulums;robot dynamics;velocity control","multiDOF two wheeled inverted pendulum robot;zero turning radius;multiDOF TWIP robot;complex full dynamics model;Lagrange method;balance control;velocity control","","5","","20","","23 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Burst and random errors, message delays, user mobility, and link outages are significant factors that influence data fusion performance. These factors become even more significant in future mobile ad hoc networking environments. To date, however, those factors are not sufficiently addressed by formulations used for modeling and predicting data fusion performance. A stochastic-based fusion formulation that incorporates the effects of non-deterministic behaviors and stochastic communications characteristics is developed and proposed as a method for predicting estimation capabilities. The resulting stochastic fusion equations enable decentralized estimation capabilities to be evaluated in communication networks having non-idealized channel characteristics and ad hoc connectivity. The method is implemented in a simulation model for decentralized estimation in networks with time-varying ad hoc connectivity. The simulation results demonstrate the ability to closely predict expected fusion performance while greatly reducing model complexity and simulation time relative to current techniques. Those findings demonstrate the efficacy of a stochastic fusion formulation for prediction, and extending the approach to a wider range of data fusion domains and techniques is recommended","","1-4244-0953-5","10.1109/ICIF.2006.301707","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.his.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085993","data fusion;mobile ad hoc networks;information fusion;distributed estimation","Uncertainty;Mobile communication;Stochastic processes;Wireless networks;Disruption tolerant networking;Mobile ad hoc networks;Communication networks;Predictive models;Delay estimation;Communication channels","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;sensor fusion;stochastic processes;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","data fusion formulation;decentralized estimation predictions;communications uncertainty;communication channel characteristics;wireless networks;burst errors;random errors;message delays;user mobility;link outages;mobile ad hoc networking;stochastic communications characteristics;stochastic fusion equations;communication networks;nonidealized channel characteristics;ad hoc connectivity;information fusion;distributed estimation","","6","","15","","12 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
