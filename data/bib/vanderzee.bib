abstract={This book is divided into three parts with Part 1 introducing the basic concepts. Part 2 presents the systems theory concepts necessary for an understanding of Part 3, which sets forth the basic framework and discusses a number of issues and problems in modelling and simulation. Chapters 1 and 2 deal with model description and basic systems concepts. With the conceptual basis so developed, the author considers the basic elements of discourse--real system, experimental frame, base model, lumped model, and the computer--and the concepts of simplification, validation, and simulation, which involve relations among the basic elements. Chapters 3 through 7 deal with the dynamics of simulation, that is, with the generation of the temporal behaviour of a model. The concept of state and the formal description of models are developed in parallel with the description of how the computer carries out the simulation process. The last chapter of Part 1 (Chapter 8) returns to the subject of modelling. The author discusses an example of discrete event modelling and introduces the concept of homomorphism as a criterion for valid simplification. Part 2 consists of two chapters. Chapter 9 develops a hierarchy of system specifications ranging from the lowest behavioural level to the highest structural level. Chapter 10 develops a parallel hierarchy of preservation relations that interrelate specifications. Part 3 opens with an axiomization of the basic framework, using the systems concepts. A number of problems common to many domains are isolated and formulated within the framework. (from preface)},

abstract={Simulation modeling provides a powerful methodology for advancing theory and research on complex behaviors and systems, yet it has been embraced more slowly in management than in some associated social science disciplines. We suspect that part of the reason is that simulation methods are not well understood. We therefore aim to promote understanding of simulation methodology and to develop an appreciation of its potential contributions to management theory by describing the nature of simulations, its attractions, and its special problems, as well as some uses of computational modeling in management research.

abstract={This paper provides a comprehensive review of discrete event simulation publications published between 2002 and 2013 with a particular focus on applications in manufacturing. The literature is classified into three general classes of manufacturing system design, manufacturing system operation, and simulation language/package development. The paper further categorizes the literature into 11 subclasses based on the application area. The current review contributes to the literature in three significant ways: (1) it provides a wide coverage by reviewing 290 papers; (2) it provides a detailed analysis of different aspects of the literature to identify research trends through innovative data mining approaches as well as insights derived from the review process; and (3) it updates and extends the existing classification schemes through identification and inclusion of recently emerged application areas and exclusion of obsolete categories. The results of the literature analysis are then used to make suggestions for future research. © 2013 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.},

abstract={Conceptual modelling is probably the most important aspect of a simulation study. It is also the most difficult and least understood. Over 40 years of simulation research and practice have provided only limited information on how to go about designing a simulation conceptual model. This paper, the first of two, discusses the meaning of conceptual modelling and the requirements of a conceptual model. Founded on existing literature, a definition of a conceptual model is provided. Four requirements of a conceptual model are described: validity, credibility, utility and feasibility. The need to develop the simplest model possible is also discussed. Owing to a paucity of advice on how to design a conceptual model, the need for a conceptual modelling framework is proposed. Built on the foundations laid in this paper, a conceptual modelling framework is described in the paper that follows. © 2008 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This introductory tutorial presents an over view of the process of conducting a simulation study of any discrete system. The basic viewpoint is that conducting such a study requires both art and science. Some of the issues addressed are how to get started, the steps to be followed, the issues to be faced at each step, the potential pitfalls occurring at each step, and the most common causes of failures.},

abstract={Over the last decade, process mining emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis of processes using event data. Classical data mining techniques such as classification, clustering, regression, association rule learning, and sequence/episode mining do not focus on business process models and are often only used to analyze a specific step in the overall process. Process mining focuses on end-to-end processes and is possible because of the growing availability of event data and new process discovery and conformance checking techniques. Process models are used for analysis (e.g., simulation and verification) and enactment by BPM/WFM systems. Previously, process models were typically made by hand without using event data. However, activities executed by people, machines, and software leave trails in so-called event logs. Process mining techniques use such logs to discover, analyze, and improve business processes. Recently, the Task Force on Process Mining released the Process Mining Manifesto. This manifesto is supported by 53 organizations and 77 process mining experts contributed to it. The active involvement of end-users, tool vendors, consultants, analysts, and researchers illustrates the growing significance of process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The practical relevance of process mining and the interesting scientific challenges make process mining one of the "hot" topics in Business Process Management (BPM). This article introduces process mining as a new research field and summarizes the guiding principles and challenges described in the manifesto. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={A new approach is suggested under the slogan "Keep it Descriptive Stupid" (KIDS) that encapsulates a trend in increasingly descriptive agentbased social simulation. The KIDS approach entails one starts with the simulation model that relates to the target phenomena in the most straightforward way possible, taking into account the widest possible range of evidence, including anecdotal accounts and expert opinion. Simplification is only applied if and when the model and evidence justify this. This contrasts sharply with the KISS approach where one starts with the simplest possible model and only moves to a more complex one if forced to. An example multiagent simulation of domestic water demand and social influence is described © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={Even though we have moved beyond the Industrial Age and into the Information Age, manufacturing remains an important part of the global economy. There is a need for the pervasive use of modeling and simulation for decision support in current and future manufacturing systems, and several challenges need to be addressed by the simulation community to realize this vision. First, an order of magnitude reduction in problem-solving cycles is needed. The second grand challenge is the development of real-time, simulation-based problem-solving capability. The third grand challenge is the need for true plug-and-play interoperability of simulations and supporting software. Finally, there is the biggest challenge facing modeling and simulation analysts today: that of convincing management to sponsor modeling and simulation projects instead of, or in addition to, more commonly used manufacturing system design and improvement methods such as lean manufacturing and six sigma. © 2004 The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.},

In order to improve the model selection process, model performance needs to be clearly defined, and suitable model attributes identified that can be used to predict the performance of the alternative candidate models. This paper distinguishes the different aspects of model performance and considers the extent to which they can be measured. The most common attributes used to compare alternative models are level of detail and complexity although these terms are used in a number of different ways. The meanings of these concepts are therefore discuss and the likely relationships with the model performance elements considered. The related area of simplification is reviewed and the areas in which further work is required are set out.},

abstract={Following on from the definition of a conceptual model and its requirements laid out in a previous paper, a framework for conceptual modelling is described. The framework consists of five iterative activities: understanding the problem situation, determining the modelling and general project objectives, identifying the model outputs, identify the model inputs, and determining the model content. The framework is demonstrated with a modelling application at a Ford Motor Company engine assembly plant. The paper concludes with a discussion on identifying data requirements from the conceptual model and the assessment of the conceptual model. © 2008 Operational Research Society Ltd.

abstract={It is generally recognized that conceptual modeling is one of the most vital parts of a simulation study. At the same time, it also seems to be one of the least understood. A review of the extant literature on conceptual modeling reveals a range of issues that need to be addressed: the definition of conceptual model(ling), conceptual model requirements, how to develop a conceptual model, conceptual model representation and communication, conceptual model validation, and teaching conceptual modeling. It is clear that this is an area ripe for further research, for the clarification of ideas and the development of new approaches. Some areas in which further research could be carried out are identified. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Skill in modeling is one of the keys to success in OR/MS practice. This has been recognized for many years, but we often give it only lip service. Models are used in many ways in OR/MS practice. A few simple principles of modeling may be useful. The six principles discussed here cover simplicity versus complexity; model development as a gradual, almost piecemeal process; dividing larger models into smaller components; using analogies; proper uses of data; and finally the way in which the modeling process can seem chaotic. Others may wish to comment on these principles and add their own.},

abstract={Conceptual modelling has gained a lot of interest in recent years and simulation modellers are particularly interested in understanding the processes involved in arriving at a conceptual model. This paper contributes to this understanding by discussing the artifacts of conceptual modelling and two specific conceptual modelling processes: knowledge acquisition and model abstraction. Knowledge acquisition is the process of finding out about the problem situation and arriving at a system description. Model abstraction refers to the simplifications made in moving from a system description to a conceptual model. Soft Systems Methodology has tools that can help a modeller with knowledge acquisition and model abstraction. These tools are drawing rich pictures, undertaking analyses 'one', 'two', 'three', and constructing a root definition and the corresponding purposeful activity model. The use of these tools is discussed with respect to a case study in health care. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Model abstraction is a method for reducing the complexity of a simulation model while maintaining the validity of the simulation results with respect to the question that the simulation is being used to address. Model developers have traditionally used a number of abstraction techniques, and simulation researchers have conducted formal research to build a theoretical foundation for model manipulation. More recently, researchers in the artificial intelligence (AI) subfield of qualitative simulation have also been developing techniques for simplifying models, determining whether models results are valid, and developing tools for automatic model selection and manipulation. Metamodeling also can be considered as an abstraction technique. The purpose of this paper is to provide a taxonomy of abstraction techniques drawn from these fields. This taxonomy provides a framework for comparing and contrasting various abstraction techniques.},

abstract={This paper examines in detail reasons for using constructively simple models in management science interventions. Constructive simplicity is an objective concept describing the form and level of detail in a model. It is distinguished from the subjective concept of transparency, which relates to user-comprehension of a model. Usual arguments for constructive simplicity focus on model-building considerations such as model clarity, flexibility and convenience. Constructively simple models are also an efficient way of learning about decision situations. Client managers may prefer constructive simplicity not only as a convenient way of ensuring transparent models, but also for reasons related to motivation, time constraints, implementation and involvement of third parties. A principal conclusion is that constructive simplicity in modelling is a robust strategy for effective interventions. © 1989, Operational Research Society Ltd.},

abstract={This paper presents a real-time scheduling methodology in a semiconductor wafer fab that produces multiple product types with different due dates. In the suggested real-time scheduling method, lot scheduling rules and batch scheduling rules are selected from sets of candidate rules based on information obtained from discrete event simulation. Since a rule combination that gives the best performance may vary according to the states of the fab, a selected rule combination is employed for a certain period of time and then a new combination is selected and employed. Since multiple simulation runs should be made in the simulation-based real-time scheduling (SBRTS) method, it may take excessively long computation time to react to unexpected events. To reduce response time, we suggest three techniques for accelerating rule comparison. We test these techniques as well as other operational policies that can be used in the SBRTS method through computational experiments on a number of test problems.},

This paper discusses why the model was developed, the structure of the model, and the impact when used to inform national policy development. The model was then used as a consultancy tool to aid struggling hospital trusts to improve their A&#38;E departments.

abstract={The concept of process abstraction, which allows simu- lationists to construct models composed of a set of interconnected levels, is discussed. Each level in the network represents the process at some given level of abstraction and is encoded using a model type (viz. Petri net, automaton, data flow graph) appropriate to that level. An example process composed of articulated figures around a circular table is presented. The process is formally defined at each level, then the abstraction relationships between levels are discussed. A taxonomy of process abstraction methods is presented in an effort to characterize the fundamental concepts of level traversal. The application involving the animation of the process is described within the context of the HIRES simulation language that was constructed specifically to simulate and analyze multilevel simulations. Textual and graphical examples of HIRES output are included. Finally, some observations on the future of process abstraction in modeling are given. © 1988 IEEE},

abstract={The conceptual model for a simulation addresses the simulation's context, how it will satisfy its requirements, and how its entities and processes will be represented. The conceptual model is key to (1) assessing a simulation's validity for any situation not explicitly tested and (2) determining the appropriateness of a simulation (or its parts) for reuse or use with other simulations in a distributed simulation. There are no widely accepted approaches for decomposing the representation of the simulation subject into the entities and processes of a simulation's conceptual model, for abstracting such representation from available information about the subject, or for describing and documenting the simulation's conceptual model. This article discusses the development of a conceptual model for both unitary and distributed simulations, focusing on approaches that enhance model completeness, consistency, coherence, and correctness. More than a decade of work at APL in this area is represented in the ideas presented here.},

abstract={In recent years hospitals have been vigorously searching for ways to reduce costs and improve productivity. One tool, simulation, is now widely accepted as an effective method for assisting management in evaluating different operational alternatives. It can help improve existing Emergency Departments (EDs) and assist in planning and designing new EDs. In order to increase the acceptance of simulation in healthcare systems in general and EDs in particular, hospital management should be directly involved in the development of these projects. Such involvement will also bolster the model's credibility, In addition, it is important to simplify simulation processes as much as is reasonably possible and use visual aids or animation that will heighten users' confidence in the model's ability. This study lays the foundation for the development of a simulation tool which is general, flexible, intuitive, simple to use and contains default values for most of the system's parameters.},

abstract={Detailed simulation models of large wafer fabrication facilities can require substantial amounts of computer execution time. Practitioners and researchers have frequently embraced the notion that, if detail must be sacrificed, it is wise to reduce detail for the low-utilization workstations. However, a specific prescription for how to reduce the detail and empirical evidence of the validity of the approximation has been lacking. In this paper we show that accurate estimates of total cycle time and equipment utilization may be obtained using reduced fabrication simulation models that replace operations at low-utilization workstations with fixed time lags. We demonstrate the accuracy of the approximation on industrial data. The criterion we use for deleting workstations from the model is the standard deviation of lot waiting time. The computer execution time for such reduced models is five to ten times less than that for complete models of the fabrication. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={How much effort will be required to compose or reuse simulations? What factors need to be considered? It is generally known that composability and reusability are daunting challenges for both simulations and more broadly software design as a whole. We have conducted a small case study in order to clarify the role that model context plays in simulation composability and reusability. For a simple problem: compute the position and velocity of a falling body, we found that a reasonable formulation of a solution included a surprising number of implicit constraints. Equally surprising, in a challenge posed to a small group of capable individuals, no one of them was able to identify more than three-quarters of the ultimate set of validation constraints. We document the challenge, interpret its results, and discuss the utility our study will have in future investigations into simulation composition and reuse.},

abstract={Health policy models provide measures of the effectiveness and costs of complex health care interventions making it possible to compare different policies. We look at the validity of models of screening, prevention and treatment, focusing on two simulation studies. In designing models, account must be taken of disease trends and changing treatment patterns. The choice of modelling technique and of system boundaries are shown to have an impact on results. Decisions have to be made about data which may be scarce or inappropriate for modelling purposes. Cost-effectiveness measures are based on the ratio of costs to benefits, such as life years saved or quality adjusted life years. These are sensitive to the time period and the discount rates chosen. Policy makers should be aware of these different sources of variability or error. For decision making purposes, the calculation of output measures must be based on the same assumptions. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Dynamic-Data-Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) is a new modeling and control paradigm which adaptively adjusts the fidelity of a simulation model. The fidelity of the simulation model is adjusted against available computational resources by incorporating dynamic data into the executing model, which then steers the measurement process for selective date update. To this end, comprehensive system architecture and methodologies are first proposed, where the components include a real-time DDDAS simulation, grid modules, a web service communication server, databases, various sensors and a real system. Abnormality detection, fidelity selection, fidelity assignment, and prediction and task generation are enabled through the embedded algorithms developed in this work. Grid computing is used for computational resources management and web services are used for inter-operable communications among distributed software components. The proposed DDDAS is demonstrated on an example of preventive maintenance scheduling in a semiconductor supply chain. Copyright © "IIE".},

abstract={Given the widespread acceptance of the importance of simplicity in management science models, the scarcity of research into simplification is perhaps surprising. In the simulation of manufacturing systems, simplification is often not attempted and, on the (misguided) assumption that more detailed models are necessarily more accurate and therefore better, common practice is to build and use the most complex model that can be built in the time available. However, for cases where the only results required are averages, such as long term throughput rates, it will often be possible to reduce the model to such a simple version that an analytical solution becomes feasible and the simulation redundant. An eight stage procedure is proposed for doing the reductions and two manufacturing case studies are described. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Supply chain management offers a large potential for organizations to reduce costs and improve customer service performance. Simulation of supply chains can help in these objectives by evaluating the impact of alternate inventory control policies. Supply chain simulation involves modeling of multiple factories across the chain and can get quite complex. Analysts typically carry out such simulation at a coarse level of detail to keep the complexity and computing resources manageable. However, modeling at coarse levels may reduce the accuracy of outputs and affect the quality of decisions. In this paper, we report on a study to compare the quality of results at different levels of details in a semiconductor supply chain simulation.},

abstract={The topic of model complexity is fundamental to model developers and model users. In this study, we investigate how over- and under-fitting of a driving function in a simulation model influences the predictive ability of the model. Secondly, we investigate whether model selection approaches succeed in selecting driving functions with the best predictive ability. We address these issues through an example with the forest simulator SORTIE-ND. Utilizing maximum likelihood methods and individual tree growth data we parameterize five growth functions of increasing complexity. We then incorporate each growth function into the simulation model SORTIE-ND and test predicted growth against independent data. Compared to the independent data, the simplest and the most complex growth functions had the poorest predictive ability while functions of intermediate complexity had the best predictive ability. The poor predictive ability of the simplest model is caused by poor approximation of the system while the poor predictive ability of the most complex model is caused by biased parameter estimates. A growth function of intermediate complexity was the most parsimonious model where error due to approximation and error due to estimation were simultaneously minimized. The model selection criteria AIC and BIC were found to select complex functions that were over-fitted according to the independent data comparison. BIC was closer to choosing the model that minimized prediction error than AIC. In this example, BIC is the more appropriate model selection criterion. It is important that both model developers and models users remember that more complex models do not always result in better predictive models. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Within the framework of the application of their industrial management system, companies compile a Master Production Schedule (MPS). However, once the MPS is released, daily events may require it to be brought into question. The use of reduced models within the framework of flow dynamic simulation enables quick decision-making while maximizing the use of resources and minimizing risk. The article shows the advantage of model reduction and how we arrive at it. Afterwards we develop an analysis of the influence of the model factors by highlighting the differences between the simulation results and MPS. Finally we show the circumstances in which the flow dynamic simulation with reduced models is relevant. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Previous work has proved that simple simulation models are sufficient for analyzing the behavior of complex wafer fabs in certain scenarios. In this paper, we give an example where the simple model fails to accurately predict cycle times and WIP levels of the complex model. To determine the reason for this behavior, we analyze the correlation properties of a MIMAC full fab model and the corresponding simple one. It turns out that the simple model is not capable of capturing the correlations in an adequate way because there is lot overtaking (passing) in the simple model while almost no overtaking can be found in the complex counterpart.},

abstract={Cycle Time - Throughput curves (CT-TH), which plot the average cycle time versus start rate for a given product mix, are often used to support decisions made in manufacturing settings, such as the impact of proposed changes in start rate on mean cycle time. Discrete event simulation is often used to generate estimations of cycle time at a significant number of traffic intensities (start rates). However, simulation often requires long run lengths and extensive output analysis. In most manufacturing environments, the time and/or budget available for such simulations is limited. As demands for faster and more accurate results are required, alternative approaches to improving simulation efficiency must be investigated. This research seeks to develop a procedure for simplifying a detailed model into a fast (abstract) simulation model that achieves a statistically indistinguishable level of accuracy and precision. This technique has particular application in the simulation of semiconductor manufacturing facilities.},

abstract={As the costs of building a new wafer fab increase, a detailed simulation model representing the production operations, the tools, the automated material handling systems (AMHS), and the tool-AMHS interactions is needed for accurately planning the capacity of these facilities. The problem is that it currently takes too long to build, experiment, and analyze a sufficiently detailed model of a fab. The key for building accurate and computationally efficient fab models is to decide on the right amount of model details, specifically those details representing the equipment capacity and the AMHS. This paper identifies a method for classifying a fab model by the level of capacity detail, the level of AMHS detail, or the level of capacity/AMHS detail. Within the capacity/AMHS modeling level, our method further differentiates between detailed integrated capacity/AMHS models and abstract coupled capacity/AMHS models. The proposed classification method serves as the basis of a framework that helps users select the system components to be modeled within a desired level of detail. This research also provides a review of past-published literature summarizing the work done at each of the proposed fab modeling levels. A case study comparing the performance between an integrated capacity/AMHS model and a coupled capacity/AMHS model is presented. The study demonstrates that the coupled model generates cycle time estimates that are not statistically different than those generated by the integrated model. This paper also shows that the coupled model can improve CPU time by approximately 98% in relation to the integrated model. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Discrete-event simulation is a well-established and rather successful method in some semiconductor companies, while other companies do not use simulation at all. Simulation is used for performance assessment and decision-making. This paper focuses on the methodological and practical issues that have to be addressed to build, use, and maintain simulation models for a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility (wafer fab). We describe and discuss the main steps of a simulation study in this domain. We seek to highlight the main issues and present alternative ways to address them. Common pitfalls in using discrete-event simulation in semiconductor manufacturing and how they can be avoided are also discussed. © 2015 International journal of industrial engineering.},

abstract={Discrete event simulation is an important system analysis technique. But for today's demand for speed, the time to complete a simulation study is considered to be long, even with current developments in hardware and simulation software. In this scenario, simplification methods for simulation models could play a key role. This paper proposes a technique for reducing the complexity of a discrete event simulation model at the conceptual phase of simulation modeling that can be fully automatized through a computer program. We applied this technique on some problems which demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We start with basic terminology and concepts of modeling, and decompose the art of modeling as a process. This overview of the process helps clarify when we should or should not use simulation models. We discuss some common missteps made by many inexperienced modelers, and propose a concrete approach for avoiding those mistakes. After a quick review of event graphs, which are a very straightforward notation for discrete event systems, we illustrate how an event graph can be translated quite directly to a computer program with the aid of a surprisingly simple library. The resulting programs are easy to implement and computationally are extremely efficient. The first half of the paper focuses principles of modeling, and should be of general interest. The second half will be of interest to students, teachers, and readers who wish to know how simulation models work and how to implement them from the ground up. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the dynamic behavior of a simple service-oriented supply chain in the presence of non-stationary demand using simulation. The supply chain contains four stages in series. Each stage holds no finished goods inventory. Rather, the order backlog can only be managed by adjusting capacity. These conditions reflect the reality of many service (and custom manufacturing) supply chains. The simulation model is used to compare various capacity management strategies. Measures of performance include application completion rate, backlog levels, and total cumulative costs.},

abstract={Semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities (wafer fabs) are among the most complex production facilities. A large product variety, hundreds of processing steps per product, hundreds of machines of different types, and automated transport lead to a system complexity which is hard to understand and hard to handle. For educating planners and developing adequate material flow control mechanisms, simple models for this complex environment are required. Several years ago, we published some first approaches which were useful to explain the fab behavior after a serious bottleneck breakdown. With that simple model, however, it was only possible to predict the cycle time distribution of the lots for a few scenarios. In this paper, we present some model improvements which lead to a rather good cycle time prediction for a variety of load situations. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={This article discusses simplification in the context of discrete event modelling and simulation. An attempt is made to automate simplification. To achieve this, the definition of homomorphism for discrete event models is weakened to be used as a formal basis. In this approach, in addition to the models themselves, the modeller specifies a set of functions which map the input, output and state sets of a model into their corresponding simplified images. Our method uses this information along with the histories of original models to identify simplified equivalents of the original models. The concepts are implemented in DEVS-Scheme, a general purpose theory-based event simulation environment. The approach uses observation data to generate lumped model code. For experimentations, the lumped model codes are substituted in place of their original models and simulations are conducted to compare the behaviors of lumped and original models. The results are reported. The article also contains a section on future directions of simplification research. © 1990, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article discusses a number of common interpretations of 'implementation' in the literature, and how these have been confused. Various different levels of implementation are then discussed, including the concept of model effectiveness. This is concerned with both the operational effectiveness of the model, as shown by a tangible improvement in the system modelled, and the personal effectiveness in helping users learn more about the system itself. Research is then described to explore various aspects of model usage and effectiveness. The research took place in the context of a business game used by a large number of practising managers. An unusual feature of the game was the fact that participants were offered the use of a number of models to aid their decisions. The usage of the models, and their effects, were measured objectively. Results showed that models were used extensively, and their effects were advantageous in a number of ways. The implications of this work are discussed. © 1985.},

abstract={To predict cycle time distributions of integrated processing workstations, detailed simulation models are almost exclusively used; these models require considerable development and maintenance effort. As an alternative, we propose an aggregate model that is a lumped-parameter representation of the workstation. The aggregate model is a single server with a work-in-process dependent aggregate process time distribution and overtaking distribution. The lumped parameters are determined directly from arrival and departure events measured at the workstation. An extensive simulation study and an industry case demonstrate that the aggregate model can accurately predict the cycle time distribution of integrated processing workstations in semiconductor manufacturing. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={For multiclass flow line models, we identify a class of service times that allow a decomposition of the system into subsets of servers called channels. In each channel, the customer delay is well structured and we develop a recursion to calculate it. The recursions provide an alternative to the elementary evolution equations. By considering batch arrivals and restricting the structure of the model, the recursions can require nearly one order of magnitude less computation than is otherwise possible. Flow lines can be used as models for semiconductor manufacturing equipment such as multicluster or clustered photolithography tools. The models allow for internal wafer buffers and setups that are wafer location dependent. The models have shown to be very accurate in tests with data from clustered photolithography tools in production. As such, the models may serve as good candidates to improve the fidelity of existing equipment models in fablevel simulation.© 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Although redundancy in model specification generally has negative connotations, we offer arguments for revising those convictions. Defining "representational redundancy" as the inclusion of any symbols not required to fulfill the study objectives, we cite several sources of redundancy, classified as accidental or intentional, that contribute positively to the model development tasks. Comparative benefits and detriments are discussed briefly. Focusing on the most interesting source of redundancy - that which is intentionally induced by a modeling methodology - we demonstrate that automated elimination of redundancy can actually improve model execution time. Using four models drawn from the literature that are easily understood, but which represent some differences in size and complexity, the direct execution of the graphical representations shows improvements over a base case ranging from 27.3 percent to 68.1 percent in execution time. Further, increasing improvement is realized with increasing model size and complexity. These results are encouraging because they suggest that modeling methodologies with automated model diagnosis can significantly reduce both execution and development time and cost.},

abstract={Complexity of a simulation model is defined as a measure that reflects the requirements imposed by models on computational resources. It is often related to the structural properties of models. In this paper, we introduce complexity measures for simulation models using the concept of Simulation Graphs. A reasonable measure of complexity is useful in a priori evaluation of proposed simulation studies that must be completed with a specified budget. They can also be useful in classifying simulation models in order to obtain a thorough test bed of models to be used in simulation methodology research. Some surrogate measures of run time complexity are also developed.},

abstract={Background Obesity care services are often faced with the need to adapt their resources to rising levels of demand. The main focus of this study was to help prioritise planned investments in new capacity allowing the service to improve patient experience and meet future anticipated demand. Methods We developed computer models of patient flows in an obesity service in an Academic Health Science Centre that provides lifestyle, pharmacotherapy and surgery treatment options for the UK's National Health Service. Using these models we experiment with different scenarios to investigate the likely impact of alternative resource configurations on patient waiting times. Results Simulation results show that the timing and combination of adding extra resources (eg, surgeons and physicians) to the service are important. For example, increasing the capacity of the pharmacotherapy clinics equivalent to adding one physician reduced the relevant waiting list size and waiting times, but it then led to increased waiting times for surgical patients. Better service levels were achieved when the service operates with the resource capacity of two physicians and three surgeons. The results obtained from this study had an impact on the planning and organisation of the obesity service. Conclusions Resource configuration combined with demand management (reduction in referral rates) along the care service can help improve patient waiting time targets for obesity services, such as the 18 week target of UK's National Health Service. The use of simulation models can help stakeholders understand the interconnectedness of the multiple microsystems (eg, clinics) comprising a complex clinical service for the same patient population, therefore, making stakeholders aware of the likely impact of resourcing decisions on the different microsystems.},

abstract={The past seventeen years has witnessed a significant transformation in discrete event modeling and simulation, and the introduction of new modeling methodology based on three-dimensional (3D) visualization and virtual reality (VR) technologies. While several studies demonstrate the benefits and costs of 3D and VR modeling in discrete event simulation (DES) based on empirical evidence, others rely on anecdotal evidence and experience from practice. Further, there are still some unsubstantiated claims about the gains and challenges arising from the application of 3D and VR technologies in DES. This paper synthesizes the realized benefits and costs associated with modeling and simulation in 3D and VR while differentiating the realities from claims (myths). The results show that 3D and VR techniques offer significant benefits in the major modeling and simulation tasks than speculated among practitioners in the simulation community. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Discrete-event simulation is a well-accepted method for planning, evaluating, and monitoring processes in production and logistics. To reduce time and effort spent on creating simulation models, automatic simulation model generation is an important area in modeling methodology research. When automatically generating a simulation model from existing data sources, the correct reproduction of dynamic behavior of the modeled system is a common challenge. One example is the representation of dispatching and scheduling strategies of production jobs. When generating a model automatically, the underlying rules for these strategies are typically unknown but yet have to be adequately emulated. In this paper, we summarize our work investigating the suitability of various data mining and supervised machine learning methods for emulating job scheduling decisions based on data obtained from production data acquisition. We report on the performance of the algorithms and give recommendations for their application, including suggestions for their integration in simulation systems. © 2016 The Operational Research Society.},

abstract={In many engineering design contexts models are indispensable. They offer decision support and help tackle complex and interconnected design projects, capturing the underlying structure of development processes or resulting products. Because managers and engineers base many decisions on models, it is crucial to understand their properties and how these might influence their behaviour. The level of detail, or granularity, of a model is a key attribute that results from how reality is abstracted in the modelling process. Despite the direct impact granularity has on the use of a model, the general topic has so far only received limited attention and is therefore not well understood or documented. This article provides background on model theory, explores relevant terminology from a range of fields and discusses the implications for engineering design. Based on this, a classification framework is synthesised, which outlines the main manifestations of model granularity. This research contributes to theory by scrutinising the nature of model granularity. It also illustrates how this may manifest in engineering design models, using Design Structure Matrices as an example, and discusses associated challenges to provide a resource for modellers navigating decisions regarding granularity.

abstract={This paper uses computational complexity theory to assess the difficulty of various discrete event simulation problems. More specifically, accessibility of states, ordering of events, noninterchangeability, of model implementations, and execution stalling for discrete event simulations are formally stated as search problems and proven to be NP-hard. The consequences of these results cover a wide range of modeling and analysis problems in simulation. For example, problems associated with certain variance reduction techniques, model verification, model validation, and the applicability of infinitesimal perturbation analysis, among others, are deemed intractable.},

abstract={In this paper, a supply chain simulation testbed for the semiconductor industry is proposed. We start by identifying requirements for such reference datasets, and then we identify the main building blocks. The nodes of the supply chain that represent semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities (wafer fabs) are built on a simulation model from the measurement and improvement of manufacturing capacity project. We present two techniques to reduce the modeling and computational burden that are able to deal with load-dependent cycle times in single front-end and back-end facilities and in the overall network. The first method models in detail only the bottlenecks in the nodes of the supply chain, while the second one uses empirical distributions for cycle time and throughput. The quality of these reduction techniques is assessed by comparing the detailed model and the models with a reduced level of detail. We present an application scenario for the testbed by simulating a semiconductor supply network. In addition, the usage of the testbed is discussed. © 2017 IEEE.},

The techniques of simplification have arisen in a variety of disciplines and have received only limited attention in ecological studies. We applied some of these techniques in three instances and report our results in this paper. All of our simplification exercises were successful in the sense of making the models under scrutiny less complex. We present our results here as a demonstration of some of these simplification techniques and to generalize about the applicability of simplification to ecological models. © 1985.},

abstract={Computer simulation models help construction engineers evaluate different strategies when planning field operations. Construction jobsites are inherently dynamic and unstructured, and thus developing simulation models that properly represent resource operations and interactions requires meticulous input data modeling. Therefore, unlike existing simulation modeling techniques that mainly target long-term planning and close to steady-state scenarios, a realistic construction simulation model reliable enough for short-term planning and control must be built using factual data obtained from ongoing processes of the real system. This paper presents the latest findings of authors' work in designing an integrated data-driven simulation framework that employs a distributed network of sensors to collect multi-modal data from construction equipment activities. Collected data are fused to create metadata structures and data mining methods are then applied to extract key parameters and discover contextual knowledge necessary to create or refine data-driven simulation models that represent the latest conditions on the ground. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper a method for controlled simplification is presented, which is able to create simplified models with specific properties concerning complexity and behavioral deviation automatically. The method requires a finite set of model component classes, of which instances a user-defined model can be created. Two techniques for simplification are used: aggregation, where a large set of components is substituted by a small set, and omission, where components are deleted without compensation. A set of simplification rules concerning the simplification techniques, the component classes and the model structures line and parallel line are defined. These rules are used by a simplification algorithm, which is embedded in a control loop of complexity measurement and behavior measurement. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Even today, medium-term production scheduling tends to be unsatisfactory in many industrial enterprises because it is usually based on escapist assumptions of fixed lead times and a mere summarising of the capacity supply and demand. These assumptions and the simplicity of the methods applied do not match the complexity of the scheduling problems to be solved. Thus the goals of the scheduling frequently fail to be achieved. Help might be at hand from simulation-based optimisation. Such optimisation, however, causes high computational costs, which will stand in the way of its practical application. This article reports a method of creating reduced simulation models of discrete production processes. The use of such reduced models instead of detailed ones lessens the computational costs considerably and hence makes the application of simulation-based optimisation for medium-term production scheduling possible. The reduction method was subjected to empirical investigation, the results of which are also presented here.},

abstract={Simulation is often used to evaluate supply chain or workshop management. This simulation task needs models, which are difficult to construct. The aim of this work is to reduce the complexity of a simulation model design. The proposed approach combines discrete and continuous approaches in order to construct speeder and simpler reduced model. The simulation model focuses on bottlenecks with a discrete approach according to the theory of constraints. The remaining of the workshop must be taken into account in order to describe how the bottlenecks are fed. It is modeled through a continuous approach thanks to a neural network. In particular, we use a multilayer perceptron. The structure of the network is determined by using a pruning procedure. For validation, this approach is applied to the modelisation of a sawmill workshop. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Despite that simulation possesses an establish background and offers tremendous promise for designing and analyzing complex production systems, manufacturing industry has been less successful in using it as a decision support tool, especially in the conceptual phase of factory design. This paper presents how simplification and aggregation strategies are incorporated in a modeling, simulation and analysis tool, with the aim of supporting decision making in conceptual phase. Conceptual modeling is guided by a framework using an object library with generic drag and drop system components and system control objects. Data inputs are simplified by the use of Effective Process Time distributions and a novel aggregation method for product mix cycle time differences. The out coming specification is through a Web Service interface handle by modeling system architecture, automatically generating a simulation model and analysis. Case studies confirm a breakthrough in project time reduction without appreciable effects on the model's fidelity. ©2008 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper is an expanded version of a talk I gave at the 2006 Winter Simulation Conference, which is the premier annual conference in the discrete-event simulation community. Each year, the conference recognizes a 'titan of the industry,' and that person is invited to deliver a 1-h presentation at a plenary session. I was honoured the titan at the 2006 conference. Since this paper was written expressly for members of the simulation community, concepts and terminology peculiar to simulation are not explained. Readers lacking a simulation background may find some portions hard to understand. The goal of this paper is to present ways in which we can deal with complexity. I believe that the explosive growth of complexity is the computing industry's number one problem. It is the root cause of many other problems, such as computer security. Paradoxically, organizations that are in the best positions to deal with complexity are the ones that are, in fact, creating and expanding complexity. In the first section of this paper, I discuss the pervasive presence of complexity in our society in general, and in the simulation community in particular. Complexity is of particular importance to the simulation community, because reducing complexity is our primary activity. We analyse complex systems, build models of them, run the models, and draw inferences that yield more easily understood characterizations of system behaviour. Reduction of complexity lies at the very core of discrete-event simulation. In the second section, I develop a framework of software traits, of which complexity is the most important. I use the framework in succeeding sections to discuss the traits and to illuminate relationships among them. Following my discussion of the framework, I present four interesting examples of the kinds of complexity I've had to face as a software developer. Next, having discussed the evils of complexity, I present a sequence of 12 techniques for reducing, or at least coping with, complexity. Since model development is a form of software development, we all develop software in one way or another. Some of the techniques are most applicable to software development, while others are more general. Finally, I present my conclusions.},

abstract={This paper presents the abstraction process to support a modular approach for simulating semiconductor supply networks by modelling each node in the network as a 'Functional Block'. In particular, a functional block to represent wafer fabrication facilities is developed, which strikes a suitable balance between a high level abstraction and modelling the detailed complexities of a manufacturing facility. We demonstrate that the model is able to produce performance estimates (average Cycle Time (CT) and Throughput (TH)) that resemble the behaviour of real-life systems and are accurate with respect to comparisons with a detailed Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model. © 2007, Inderscience Publishers.},

abstract={Traditional business process-based discrete event simulation is not sufficiently powerful to support change-related business process reengineering (BPR). The simulation methods are inadequate for describing large, complex systems and are difficult to change so as to simulate new BPR designs. The limitations are caused by (1) focusing on workflow; (2) low-abstraction conceptual models; and (3) a lack of separate opinions on design and implementation. Our research is based on enterprise engineering, a construction-based approach, rather than workflow. By clarifying the differences between and dependencies of the ontological and implementation models, this research proposes a generic framework for generating a modularized and component-based simulation model with increased reusability as well as with the capacity to make controllable changes in enterprise simulation. The method is assumed to assist BPR by reducing complexity and through its focus on enterprise engineering-based design thinking and human-centered interactions. © 2015 Operational Research Society Ltd.},

abstract={Production planning using simulation has been gaining popularity as manufacturing routings become more complicated. However, a detailed simulation model that contains hundreds of machines and thousands of operations is far too large and complex to work with. The thesis in this research is that production planners at plant level do not need to see all the details of the shop floor to develop an effective production plan. Simulation model used for production planning can be simplified to ensure maintainability and manageability of the model. Model simplification is done in two stages, namely aggregation and condensation. Model aggregation reduces the number of routings in the model by using representative flows, whereas model condensation reduces the number of elements in a model by eliminating high throughput rate workstations. Both strategies reduce the complexity of a simulation model without sacrificing its accuracy. Experimental results using real-life data indicate that the simplified model is a valid representation of the detailed model, and can be used for high level production planning. t-Tests are used to compare the results of the detailed and simplified simulation model. Finally, rules of thumb are developed to standardize the simplification strategy.},

abstract={Stroke care has been identified as an area where operations research has great potential. In recent years there has been a small but sustained stream of discrete-event simulation case studies in modelling hyperacute stroke systems. The nature of such case studies has led to a fragmented knowledge base and high entry cost to stroke modelling research. Two common issues have faced researchers in stroke care: understanding the logistics and clinical aspects of stroke care and moving from these findings to an appropriately detailed model. We aim to accelerate studies in this area by introducing a conceptual modelling framework that is domain specific for stroke. A domain specific framework trades-off the wide applicability of a general framework against increased efficiency and reuse to support modelling in the problem domain. This compromise is appropriate when the problem domain is complex, of high value to society, and where the saving in future modelling effort is likely to be greater than the effort to create the framework. We detail the requirements of a domain specific conceptual model and then provide domain specific knowledge to support modellers in gaining an understanding of the problem situation, translating this knowledge into selected model outputs, inputs and content in the case of hyperacute stroke. We illustrate the use of the framework with an example based at a large hospital in the United Kingdom. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Simulation modelling is the business of reducing complexity of the real world. Keep your models small and simple, is the basic heuristic found in simulation & modelling literature; yet the modellers are developing models of increasing size and complexity. Simulation model size and complexity is generally a less debated and poorly understood area. Despite the importance of model simplification and its relation with size and complexity; only a handful of papers, addressing the size and complexity of simulation models, can be found. This paper reports on general concepts of simulation model size and complexity held by expert modellers and proposes a framework to understand the origins of simulation model size and complexity. Size and complexity are two most important contextual factors that may affect simulation practice. Increased understanding of concepts of simulation model size and complexity held by the modellers will potentially underpin simulation methodology research and help us in addressing the issues raised by increasing size and complexity of simulation models. © 2016, Vienna University of Technology.

abstract={Abstraction level of complex simulation models such as large manufacturing systems is always a critical factor in simulation projects. It not only helps define boundaries of a simulation model but also defines the complexity and resource requirements for the model. Many a times a simple looking model grows into a complex model because of incorrect choices in abstraction level. Developing the model in stages or steps of abstraction is sometimes a favored approach. In this paper we study and analyze 'why' and 'how' these choices in abstraction level of a simulation model at various stages in a project's life cycle results in answering the objective function more precisely. Using several automotive manufacturing case studies, We discuss the challenges relating to complexity and methodological issues, and the procedures involved in managing the same. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Simulation modeling has been around for many years and produced many papers. Arguably, there has been a lack of impact in the health arena, some may say due to modeling such a large, complex, diverse and often interconnected industry. Other observations suggests that academics get rewarded for publishing large complicated models with detailed analysis rather than focusing on the requirements of the environment or the needs of implementation. This paper attempts to add to the modeling debate by suggesting that average simulation process times can act as estimators for real length of stay. This paper will also illustrate how average process time models could be used to help reconfigure emergency care services models. Average time simulation models have the potential to make a valuable contribution to modeling and they support simplified, transparent models with shortened development time. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Performance evaluation using queueing models is common practice in semiconductor manufacturing. Analytical closed-form expressions and simulation models are popular in capacity planning and the analysis of equipment configurations. However, the complexity of semiconductor processes complicates the modeling of the equipment. Analytical models lack the required accuracy, whereas simulation models require too many details, making them impractical. Aggregation is a way to overcome this difficulty. The various details are not modeled in detail, but their contribution is lumped in the aggregate model, which makes the model more appropriate for both analysis and simulation. This paper gives an overview of our efforts to develop a top-down aggregate modeling approach for semiconductor equipment, starting from the effective process time concept inspired by the Factory Physics book of Hopp and Spearman. The strong feature of our modeling approach is that the aggregate model parameters are estimated directly from industrial data (arrival and departure times), without the need to quantify the various details. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In new Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, product-driven systems (PDS) architectures require emulation tool (Thomas, A., Genin, P., and Lamouri, S., 2008. Mathematical programming approaches for stable tactical and operational planning in supply chain and APS context. Journal of Decision Systems, 17, 425-455) to be developed. Discrete events simulation is often used to build such an emulation tool, nevertheless this remains complex because of large-scale problems. The goal of this article is to propose a way to design a simulation model by reducing its complexity. According to the theory of constraints, we build reduced models composed exclusively of bottlenecks and a neural network. In particular, a multilayer perceptron is used. The structure of the network is determined using a pruning procedure. This study highlights the impact of discrete data on the computational results. An application to a sawmill internal supply chain is suggested to validate the proposed approach. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This paper compares two fundamentally different approaches and their efforts to create functional simulation models to analyze and optimize construction operations. It contrasts the traditional manually created discrete-event simulation with an automated simulation model generation engine. While input data remain the same for both, the former requires a user to extensively determine, creates, and connects the different elements, followed by an often time-consuming verification to correct flaws in details. The latter has the proven potential to radically reduce the time, cost, and skills of creating complex models by using process templates from which models for construction applications can be rapidly deployed. Moving from the traditional paradigm to automated, yet user-supervised modeling can finally make the rich body of knowledge in simulation accessible to practitioners, who can reap new benefits from being able to rehearse their projects in the computer and optimize their processes before any costly physical resources are committed. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={In this panel discussion five leading simulation practitioners discuss a number of critical issues facing a person who is trying to use simulation to design a new system or to improve the performance of an existing system. John Carson, Kenneth Musselman, and Onur Ulgen are consultants, while Jerry Fox/Stephen Halladin are major users of simulation at a company that very extensively employs this technology. The questions discussed in this article were chosen by the discussants and myself based on our collective years of simulation modeling experience as being both important and of general interest. One of the questions - how to determine the level of model detail - is, perhaps, the single most difficult methodological issue confronting an analyst trying to model a large, complex system. If there is not enough detail in the model, then it will probably be invalid and produce erroneous results. On the other hand, an overly detailed model may result in missed deadlines and in excessive computer execution time or memory requirements. Two additional questions address the ingredients for overall project success and how to collect good information/data on the system of interest. Finally, the discussants give their views on where the field of simulation modeling is headed in the next three years. This discussion is based in part on a similar paper by Law (1993).},

abstract={Current complexity metrics based on graphical analysis or static program characteristics are not well suited for discrete-event simulation model representations, owing to their inherent dynamics. A complexity metric suitable for model representations is described. A study of existing metrics provides a basis for the development of the desired metric, and a set of characteristics for a simulation model complexity metric is defined. A metric is described that is based on the two types of complexity that are apparent in model representations. Experimental data are presented to verify that this metric possesses the desired characteristics and appears to offer an improvement over existing metrics.},

abstract={This paper presents a knowledge based approach to increase the use of simulation in the construction industry without its users having to become or hire experts in simulation techniques. The premise of this approach is to use existing process-related schedule information as inputs to create a functioning simulation model with little or no user intervention. It explains analytical capabilities and limitations of schedules and simulation, reviews previous discrete event simulation studies, and discusses integrating knowledge from this domain. It describes the architecture of the WorkSim® system. A case study presents processes of a real construction project. The conceptual and pragmatic feasibility of converting schedules into simulations is tested with its representative sample dataset. Modeling and analyzing this case study establishes the technical viability of the ideas discussed in the paper. Future work will examine challenges to the quality of such models, e.g. their resolution, required resource data, and duration distributions. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The author critically examines possibilities for a formal basis of model abstraction and possibilities for procedures to perform model abstraction. It is noted that model abstraction is frequently done by modelers when the complexity of their models exceeds the power of their resources, i.e., too much space or time would be taken by simulations. It is the responsibility of simulation methodologists to propose sound ways of generating more abstract models from more detailed ones. Model abstraction also serves the purpose of learning more about model behavior and inferring properties that otherwise may remain uncovered. It is pointed out that no complete theories of model abstraction exist, nor does any sufficiently general procedure.},

The author reports on the effects of the commonly made assumptions of no rework, representing rework by increasing process times, no operator constraints, and no machine failures. The author uses a detailed, flexible model in which the assumptions may or may not be made. The base case, validated for a real line, makes none of the simplifying assumptions listed and is compared with subsequent runs making each assumption in turn. Generally, performance is degraded. In some cases the performance measures (resources utilization, work-in-process, and cycle times) remain within 20% of the base case.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to present a statistically based methodology for selecting the method to be used for generating sample values in a simulation model when alternate methods are available. Choosing which method to use is not a simple task, but very important because it affects the complexity and ultimately the costs associated with the model's development and the model's expected uses. The methodology is presented by means of a case study where it was used in the development of a timber harvesting simulation model. The methodology is primarily based upon analysis of variance and demonstrates one way which has been used in choosing between varying levels of complexity in generating random samples within a simulation model using as a criterion the validity of the alternate methods' results. © 1984.},

abstract={It is well-known that semiconductor manufacturing is one of the most complex types of production. Consequently, making the right decisions in order to get the optimum output of a semiconductor fab is quite challenging. For that reason, sophisticated discrete event simulation studies may be seen as a kind of magic tool for fab managers to face the ever-increasing complexity. But building complex dynamic simulation models in order to solve complex problems is not always the best solution. This article gives an overview of the discussion about the correct level of complexity of discrete event simulation models and lists the main reasons for the creation of overcomplex models. To provide guidance for practitioners, lessons learned are derived from four "real world" use cases in which the correct level of complexity was a major issue. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In conceptual analysis of higher level manufacturing systems, for instance when the constraint on system level is sought, it may not be very practical to use detailed simulation models. Developing detailed models on supply chain level or plant wide level may be very time consuming and might also be computationally costly to execute, especially if optimization techniques are to be applied. Aggregation techniques, simplifying a detailed system into fewer objects, can be an effective method to reduce the required computational resources and to shorten the development time. An aggregated model can be used to identify the main system constraints, dimensioning inter-line buffers, and focus development activities on the critical issues from a system performance perspective. In this paper a novel line aggregation technique suitable for manufacturing systems optimization is proposed, analyzed and tested in order to establish a proof of concept while demonstrating the potential of the technique. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Fab-level discrete-event simulation is an important practical tool for the analysis and optimization of semiconductor wafer fabricators. In such facilities, a clustered photolithography tool (CPT) is by far the most expensive tool and often the capacity bottleneck. In this paper, we consider linear, affine, flow line, and detailed models of CPTs for use in fab-level simulation. We develop extensions to affine and flow line models and demonstrate exactly how to convert raw CPT data into the various models. Using a detailed CPT model based on industry data as the baseline, numerical experiments are conducted to test the models' fidelity for cycle time, lot residency time, and throughput. We also compare the computational burden of each model class. Further simulations are conducted to test the models' robustness to changing fab conditions, e.g., when lot size or train size changes. Flow line models are shown to be more accurate and robust than linear or affine models and require approximately 200 times less computation than detailed models. © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) requires expensive diagnostic equipment and is labor intensive. To evaluate the effective use of the MRI resources a curve of flow time versus throughput may be helpful in quantifying the trade-off between patient waiting time and resource utilization, and in providing insight into operational time losses and variability. This curve may be obtained by simulation. However, building a detailed simulation model of an MRI department requires expertise typically unavailable in hospitals. To overcome this difficulty, we seek for an appropriate aggregate model of the MRI department, either a simulation or an analytical model. The aggregate model parameters are to be determined from hospital patient arrival and departure times. We study three different aggregate models for use in the MRI setting. To be able to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the candidate aggregate models we use a detailed simulation model as virtual MRI department. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Dispatching rules are widely used for scheduling of wafer fabrication facilities, and simulation is a popular tool for evaluation of rules. A main weakness of simulation is the long computation time. In this paper, we aim at simplifying the models of fabrication facilities to reduce simulation time and meanwhile keep the ability of evaluating rules correctly. We propose a metric to assess how well a simplified model evaluates rules and formulate the model simplification problem as a multiobjective optimization problem. We also develop an evolutionary algorithm to solve the formulated problem. Experimental results show that simplified models generated by the proposed algorithm can save half of simulation time and select high-performance rules. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Simulation model is extensively used for evaluation of dispatching rules in semiconductor wafer fabrication. However, due to the high complexity of the simulation model, the simulation is so time-consuming that it cannot response to the dynamic changes of practical fabrication well. In order to reduce computer execution time and in the same time maintain the ability of the model to evaluate the scheduling rules correctly, a model reduction method based on selective clustering ensemble algorithm (SCEA) and Theory of Constraints (TOC) is proposed. Firstly, SCEA is adopted to identify the unimportant machines steadily, in which multiple base clusterings (BCs) are trained by k-means with different initial cluster centers and then are combined into a final result based on selective weight-voting strategy. Secondly, unimportant machines are removed from the detailed model, since such machines may not significantly affect the performance of the system, according to TOC. Thirdly, closed-loop correction structure is built to ensure the robustness of the reduced model. Finally, the reduced simulation model is used to evaluate the dispatching rules respectively with the scheduling objective of on-time delivery (OTD) rate, mean cycle time (MCT) and throughput. The simulation results show that the method presented is available and effective. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Usually simulation studies of automated material handling systems of semiconductor fabs are extremely time consuming. This is due to the high detail of models used for investigations which are partly provided by transportation system suppliers. These models only provide poor possibilities for adjustment and are computationally expensive. The article will address these issues by proposing an adjustable supplier-independent base simulation model. It allows easy building, adjusting, and running simulation models of path-based systems without deeper programming knowledge. A use case of Infineon's Dresden fab revealed simulation results with an accuracy in the same range as the supplier models while disregarding a few details and thus showing significant time savings in modeling and adjusting the system as well as running simulation studies. This can be done by choosing an appropriate level of abstraction. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Oncology clinics face several complexities in their processes. When patients arrive at the infusion chairs, nurses and pharmacy technicians must be available to get the patients ready for the infusion and mix their drug treatments. This requires having the right information at the right moment. This research develops a detailed discrete event simulation model which considers the interactions between resources, information, and patient flow. The model was used to evaluate different scheduling policies and determine which of them could be incorporated in the clinic with the objective of increasing daily throughput without affect-ing patient wait time or total time in the system. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Simplicity and validity are recognized as important attributes of an effective simulation model. However, some disagreement exists both on the definitions of these concepts and on quantitative measures for them. This paper introduces Enrichment Level (EL) for (simulation) models. The EL is a quantitative measure to compare the effectiveness of alternative models when used in a particular project. While there is no conceptual restriction on expanding the EL, it currently captures the bias, speed, variance, and scope of a model as the main contributing enrichment factors. This paper explores these factors and suggests a utility-based method to combine them according to the relative importance of each enrichment factor. Model effectiveness measures currently used in academic and industrial studies are discussed and compared to the proposed EL. In order to show the usability of EL as a model comparison tool, we study an example of a queue with multi-failure mode servers and apply our method to facilitate decisions about choosing the most suitable model among a set of three. © 2012 Operational Research Society Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper a method is presented for mapping the simulation state between models of different level of detail in dynamic multiresolution modeling of discrete event material flow systems. In dynamic multiresolution modeling it is possible to inactivate a model part of certain detail and activate a model of higher or lower detail representing the same part of the system during simulation. To allow a consistent simulation, the state of the inactivated model has to be mapped to the activated model. The mapping is done by first mapping the jobs, then mapping the breakdown status and statistical variables. Experiments show that consistent states are generated, such that the simulation continues after state mapping. The errors generated by mapping are small and caused by the loss of information in the models of lower detail. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Put simply a model is a representation of 'something else'. Models may take many forms ranging from scaled models used to represent real world physical objects, such as buildings and new consumer products, to sophisticated computer models used to represent quite complex and often abstract systems, such as financial and investment strategies. However since individuals perceive and interpret situations differently, the same can be said for their perceptions and interpretations of what a model might represent. In the case of a model this could include the model builder, users and even members of the public. Fundamental to the model building process, is the selection and use of various abstraction techniques used by model builders to simplify the 'something else' they are seeking to represent. One of the major issues concerned with simplifying 'something else', be it a relatively simple or complex situation, is determining which factors can be confidently removed from the situation without impacting on the reliability and validity of a model that is subsequently built to emulate or represent it. In essence, once a factor or series of factors are removed from a situation, the situation itself is changed. Further, models are often deliberately built and used specifically to form the basis for analysis and investigation over time using simulation techniques, the results of which are then used to support individual and organisational decision making the consequences of which may even impact on innocent third parties. In this context, this paper will provide a brief examination of the concept of simplification and various approaches to simplification utilised by model builders and simulationists. It will then attempt to provide an ethical analysis of the implications associated with how much and what kind of information should model and simulation builders be reasonably required to disclose to potential users of their products so that any decisions these users make on the basis of information obtained from a model or simulation output can be undertaken in the utmost good faith. © MODSIM 2009.All rights reserved.},

abstract={The graph transformation based method presented in this paper can automatically generate simulation models assuming that the models are intended for a certain domain. The method differs from other methods in that: the data used for model generation does not contain specifications of the model structures to be generated; the generated simulation models have structures that are dynamically constructed during the model generation process. Existing data typically has quality issues and does not contain all types of information, particularly in terms of model structure, that are required for modelling. To solve the problem, transformation rules are designed to infer the required model selection and structure information from the data. The rules are specified on meta-models of the original data structure, of intermediate structures and of the simulation model. Graph patterns, pattern composites and graph pattern matching algorithms are used to define and identify potential model components. Model composite structures are represented by hypergraphs according to which simulation models are generated using model components as building blocks. The method has been applied practically in the domain of light-rail transport. © 2016 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Accurate and simple simulation flow model is useful to make decision at the right time to manage supply chain or workshop. To do that, different reduction model complexity approaches have been proposed. One of them is to associate discrete event model of bottlenecks and continuous model of other work centers according to the theory of constraints. The continuous approximation is used only do determine how the bottlenecks are fed. Different continuous model have been proposed in the past. This paper focuses on the association of regression trees and neural networks in order to benefit of the advantages of each other. This approach is used for the modeling of a sawmill workshop and the results are compared with those obtained previously by using only CART model or neural network model. © 2015 International Institute for Innovation, Industrial Engineering and Entrepreneurship - I4e2.},

abstract={In this article, we introduce complexity measures for simulation models. The framework of simulation graphs sets the context. A quantifiable measure of complexity is useful in an a priori evaluation of proposed simulation studies that must be completed within a specified budget. They can also be useful in classifying simulation models to obtain a thorough test bed of models to be used in simulation methodology research. The metrics introduced in this article have a rigorous theoretical, as well as empirical, grounding in software engineering. As such, simulation modeling and analysis represent a new area of application. Some surrogate measures of run time complexity are also developed. In particular, we provide estimates for the size of the future events list (or the pending event set). The proposed metrics are illustrated and compared through a limited set of examples. Limitations of the current approach as well as directions for future research are discussed. © 1998 INFORMS.},

abstract={Simulation is becoming a popular tool, aided by the development of powerful and faster computers, new features like parallel and distributed simulation and easier simulation software that allows to reduce the time to implement a model. In spite of that, the cycle time of a simulation study is still long. This paper presents some remarks on Model Reduction Reasoning and how through this, the time of a simulation study could be reduced. The discussion is based on the example of Kienbaum and Paul (1994) of the Pub Problem, using a simplification of their H-ACD representation to describe the original and reduced models. The models are implemented and the results obtained shows their statistical equivalence which suggests the feasibility of this approach.},

abstract={Evaluation of supply chain or workshop management is often based on simulation. This simulation task needs models which are difficult to design. The aim of this work is to reduce the complexity of simulation model design and to partially automate this task by combining discrete and continuous approaches in order to construct more efficient and reduced model. Model design focuses on bottlenecks with a discrete approach according to the theory of constraints. The remaining of the workshop is modeled in a less precise way by using continuous model in order to describe only how the bottlenecks are fed. This used continuous model is a regression tree algorithm. For validation, this approach is applied to the modeling of a sawmill workshop and the results are compared with results obtained previously by using a neural network model. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2014.},

abstract={Model abstraction is a method for reducing the complexity of a simulation model while maintaining the validity of the simulation results with respect to the question that the simulation is being used to address. Frantz1 identified and categorized a number of abstraction techniques drawn from both traditional simulation modeling and more recent approaches such as qualitative simulation and metamodeling. In this paper, we consider how to make practical use of the abstraction concept. We first look at some examples of abstractions to illustrate the concepts and applications of abstractions in the context of actual models. We then generalize these examples to discuss a methodology for using abstractions as the basis for model analysis and design.},
