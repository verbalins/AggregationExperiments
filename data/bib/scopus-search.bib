abstract={Global surrogate modeling aims to build a surrogate model with high accuracy covering the entire design domain. A major challenge to achieve this objective is how to reduce the number of function evaluations of the original computer simulation model. To date, the most widely used approach for global surrogate modeling is the adaptive surrogate modeling method. It starts with an initial surrogate model, which is then refined adaptively using the mean square error or by maximizing the minimum distance criteria. It is observed that current methods may not be able to effectively construct a global surrogate model when the underlying black box function is locally highly nonlinear. A new surrogate modeling method which can allocate more training points in regions with high nonlinearity is needed to overcome this challenge. This paper proposes an efficient global surrogate modeling method based on a multi-layer sampling scheme. An initial surrogate model is constructed first with a small group of training points. After that, samples of input variables are generated in multiple layers over the design domain. The generated samples are space-filling over the design domain and across layers. From the generated samples, new training points and candidate training points are identified in different layers by directly minimizing the prediction bias of the surrogate model. This enables us to improve the accuracy of the surrogate model more effectively than current available methods. Several mathematical examples and a vibratory system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed global surrogate modeling method. The results show that the proposed method performs better than the most widely used variance minimization method. © 2018 SAE International. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Quantification of uncertainty of a technical system is often based on a surrogate model of a corresponding simulation model. In any application the simulation model will not describe the reality perfectly, and consequently also the surrogate model will be imperfect. In this article we show how observed data of the real technical system can be used to im-prove such a surrogate model, and we analyze the rate of convergence of density estimates based on the improved surrogate model. The results are illustrated by applying the estimates to simulated and real data. © 2021, Institute of Mathematical Statistics. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Surrogate models have proved to be a suitable replacement for complex simulation models in various applications. Runtime considerations, complexity reduction, and privacy concerns play a role in the decision to use a surrogate model. The choice of an appropriate surrogate model though is often tedious and largely dependent on the individual model properties. A tool can help to facilitate this process. To this end, we present a surrogate modeling process supporting tool that simplifies the process of generation and application of surrogate models in a co-simulation framework. We evaluate the tool in our application context, energy system co-simulation, and apply it to different simulation models from that domain with a focus on decentralized energy units. © 2019 Polish Information Processing Society - as since.},

abstract={Quantification of uncertainty of a technical system is often based on a surrogate model of a corresponding simulation model. In any application, the simulation model will not describe the reality perfectly, and consequently the surrogate model will be imperfect. In this article, we combine observed data from the technical system with simulated data from the imperfect simulation model in order to estimate an improved surrogate model consisting of multilayer feedforward neural networks, and we show that under suitable assumptions, this estimate is able to circumvent the curse of dimensionality. Based on this improved surrogate model, we show a rate of the convergence result for density estimates. The finite sample size performance of the estimates is illustrated by applying them to simulated data. The practical usefulness of the newly proposed estimates is demonstrated by using them to predict the uncertainty of a lateral vibration attenuation system with piezo-elastic supports. © 2020, The Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo.},

abstract={In simulation-based realization of complex systems, we are forced to address the issue of computational complexity. One critical issue that must be addressed is the approximation of reality using surrogate models to replace expensive simulation models of engineering problems. In this paper, we critically review over 200 papers. We find that a framework for selecting appropriate surrogate modeling methods for a given function with specific requirements has been lacking. Having such a framework for surrogate model users, specifically practitioners in industry, is very important because there is very limited information about the performance of different models before applying them on the problem. Our contribution in this paper is to address this gap by creating practical guidance based on a trade-off among three main drivers, namely, size (how much information is necessary to compute the surrogate model), accuracy (how accurate the surrogate model must be) and computational time (how much time is required for the surrogate modeling process). Using the proposed guidance a huge amount of time is saved by avoiding time-consuming comparisons before selecting the appropriate surrogate model. To make this contribution, we review the state-of-the-art surrogate modeling literature to answer the following three questions: (1) What are the main classes of the design of experiment (DOE) methods, surrogate modeling methods and model-fitting methods based on the requirements of size, computational time, and accuracy? (2) Which surrogate modeling method is suitable based on the critical characteristics of the requirements of size, computational time and accuracy? (3) Which DOE is suitable based on the critical characteristics of the requirements of size, computational time and accuracy? Based on these three characteristics, we find six different qualitative categories for the surrogate models through a critical evaluation of the literature. These categories provide a framework for selecting an efficient surrogate modeling process to assist those who wish to select more appropriate surrogate modeling techniques for a given function. It is also summarized in Table 4 and Figs. 2, 3. MARS, response surface models, and kriging are more appropriate for large problems, acquiring less computation time and high accuracy, respectively. Also, Latin Hypercube, fractional factorial designs and D-Optimal designs are appropriate experimental designs. Our contribution is to propose a qualitative evaluation and a mental model which is based on quantitative results and findings of authors in the published literature. The value of such a framework is in providing practical guide for researchers and practitioners in industry to choose the most appropriate surrogate model based on incomplete information about an engineering design problem. Another contribution is to use three drivers, namely, computational time, accuracy, and problem size instead of using a single measure that authors generally use in the published literature. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Surrogate models are popular tool to approximate the functional relationship of expensive simulation models in multiple scientific and engineering disciplines. Successful use of surrogate models can provide significant savings of computational cost. However, with a variety of surrogate model approaches available in literature, it is a difficult task to select an appropriate one at hand. In this paper, we present an overview of surrogate model approaches with an emphasis of their application for variance-based global sensitivity analysis, including polynomial regression model, high-dimensional model representation, state-dependent parameter, polynomial chaos expansion, Kriging/Gaussian Process, support vector regression, radial basis function, and low rank tensor approximation. The accuracy and efficiency of these approaches are compared with several benchmark examples. The strengths and weaknesses of these surrogate models are discussed, and the recommendations are provided for different types of applications. For ease of implementations, the packages, as well as toolboxes, of surrogate model techniques and their applications for global sensitivity analysis are collected. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In vehicle design modeling and simulation, surrogate model is commonly used to replace the high fidelity Finite Element (FE) model. A lot of simulation data from the high-fidelity FE model are utilized to construct an accurate surrogate model requires. However, computational time of FE model increases significantly with the growing complexities of vehicle engineering systems. In order to attain a surrogate model with satisfactory accuracy as well as acceptable computational time, this paper presents a model updated strategy based on multifidelity surrogate models. Based on a high-fidelity FE model and a low-fidelity FE model, an accurate multi-fidelity surrogate model is modeled. Firstly, the original full vehicle FE model is simplified to get a sub-model with acceptable accuracy, and it is able to capture the essential behaviors in the vehicle side impact simulations. Next, a primary response surface model (RSM) is built based on the simplified sub-model simulation data. Bayesian inference based bias term is modeled using the difference between the high-fidelity full vehicle FE model simulation data and the primary RSM running results. The bias is then incorporated to update the original RSM. This method can enhance the precision of surrogate model while saving computational time. A real-world side impact vehicle design case is utilized to demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy. Copyright © 2018 ASME},

abstract={The paper presents a computationally efficient meta-modeling approach to spatially explicit uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in a cellular automata (CA) urban growth and land-use simulation model. The uncertainty and sensitivity of the model parameters are approximated using a meta-modeling method called polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). The parameter uncertainty and sensitivity measures obtained with PCE are compared with traditional Monte Carlo simulation results. The meta-modeling approach was found to reduce the number of model simulations necessary to arrive at stable sensitivity estimates. The quality of the results is comparable to the full-order modeling approach, which is computationally costly. The study shows that the meta-modeling approach can significantly reduce the computational effort of carrying out spatially explicit uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in the application of spatio-temporal models. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In simulations of complex physical phenomena, model reductions are often required to decrease the computation time of the simulation model to a feasible level. Model reduction is often obtained by using a reduced model, which may be based on a reduced numerical approximation and simplifications of the underlying accurate model. The use of a reduced model, however, induces errors to the simulation results. In this paper, we describe and evaluate a novel approach for the correction of the approximation errors in reduced simulation models. The key idea is to model the approximation error between the accurate and reduced simulation model as an additive noise term to the reduced model and construct a low-cost predictor model for the approximation error based on statistical learning. In this paper, the approximation error approach is evaluated with the following problems: correction of spatial and temporal discretization errors in a time-varying heat equation- based evolution model, correction of spatial discretization errors in a Navier-Stokes velocity field simulation model, and correction of errors due to the use of a simplified physical model in cloud droplet formation simulation. The low-cost predictor of the approximation error is constructed and compared using six different regressor models. In all test cases, the approximation error-corrected simulation improved significantly the accuracy of the reduced model and also outperformed the conventional approach where a statistical learning-based predictor is constructed directly for the accurate model. Further, the computation times of the approximation error-corrected models were significantly smaller than those of the corresponding accurate models. © 2018 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract={This paper presents a probabilistic framework for discrepancy prediction in dynamical system models under untested input time histories, based on information gained from validation experiments. Two surrogate modeling-based methods, namely observation surrogate and bias surrogate, are developed to predict the bias of a dynamical system simulation model under untested input time history. In the first method, a surrogate model is built for the observed experimental output, and the model bias for the untested input is obtained by comparing the output of the observation surrogate with the output of the physics-based model. The second method constructs a surrogate model for the bias in terms of the inputs in the conducted experiments. The bias surrogate model is then used to correct the simulation model prediction at each time-step under a predictor–corrector scheme to predict the model bias under untested conditions. A neural network-based surrogate modeling technique is employed to implement the proposed methodology. The bias prediction result is reported in a probabilistic manner, in order to account for the uncertainty of the surrogate model prediction. An air cycle machine case study is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bias prediction framework. © 2019 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). All rights reserved.},

abstract={Despite recent advances in computational science, the adoption of computationally intensive, high-fidelity simulation models remains a challenge for many structural dynamics applications, especially those within the domain of uncertainty quantification (UQ), requiring repeated calls to a computationally intensive simulator. Reduced order and surrogate models offer an attractive alternative to circumvent this challenge. This contribution investigates how these modeling principles can be leveraged for different UQ applications. For both types of approximate models, the development of the corresponding (reduced order or surrogate) model is directly informed through simulations of the high-fidelity numerical model. The tuning of the approximate model aims to improve accuracy for the specific UQ task at hand, rather than targeting a globally accurate approximation. The specific applications discussed correspond to seismic loss estimation (for reduced order modeling) and posterior sampling for Bayesian inference (for surrogate modeling). © Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2020.},

abstract={Simulation models are meant to support industrial engineers in understanding complex problems and provide useful insights facilitating their solution. Models achieve this by reducing focus to system elements that matter. Surprisingly, despite its relevance, simulation model simplification is still very much a green field. This is mirrored in existing literature and course materials. In this article we seek to foster development of the field by proposing a framework for simulation model simplification addressing the manufacturing domain, thereby building on an extensive literature review. The framework structures the field by providing a unifying view on simulation model simplification, in terms of its key activities, i.e., reducing and preventing model complexity, and support offered in performing these. Apart from its role as a focal point for future research, the framework is meant to benefit practitioners and educators, by giving them access to research findings, and enabling and legitimatizing development of educational materials and their uptake. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A stochastic optimization model based on an adaptive feedback correction process and surrogate model uncertainty was proposed and applied for remediation strategy design at a dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL)-contaminated groundwater site. One hundred initial training samples were obtained using the Latin hypercube sampling method. A surrogate model of a multiphase flow simulation model was constructed based on these samples employing the self-adaptive particle swarm optimization kriging (SAPSOKRG) method. An optimization model was built, using the SAPSOKRG surrogate model as a constraint. Then, an adaptive feedback correction process was designed and applied to iteratively update the training samples, surrogate model, and optimization model. Results showed that the training samples, the surrogate model, and the optimization model were effectively ameliorated. However, the surrogate model is an approximation of the simulation model, and some degree of uncertainty exists even though the surrogate model was ameliorated. Therefore, residuals between the surrogate model and the simulation model were calculated, and an uncertainty analysis was conducted. Based on the uncertainty analysis results, a stochastic optimization model was constructed and solved to obtain optimal remediation strategies at different confidence levels (60, 70, 80, 90, 95%) and under different remediation objectives (average DNAPL removal rate ≥ 70, ≥ 75, ≥ 80, ≥ 85, ≥ 90%). The optimization results demonstrated that the higher the confidence level and remediation objective, the more expensive was remediation. Therefore, decision makers can weigh remediation costs, confidence levels, and remediation objectives to make an informed choice. This also allows decision makers to determine the reliability of a selected strategy and provides a new tool for DNAPL-contaminated groundwater remediation design. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The DEVS formalism consists in a rigorous frame for model building and simulating. One one hand, the mathematical description of the DEVS meta-model allows for thorough building of models. One the other hand, the proposed algorithms for model simulation allow for quickly building simulating tools for these models. However, in between these two phases, there are some less-detailed steps such as components initial state handling. This article aims at proposing an interpretation of DEVS formalism slightly different from the one generally observed, and at strengthening the executable model building stage. The article proposes to explicitly split the model description between an user-defined abstract model and an executable model which construction can be automatically done by the simulating tool. Based on this vision, the initial state of executable models can be managed from within the DEVS formalism. © 2020 EUROSIS-ETI.},

abstract={Coastal aquifers are hydraulically connected to the sea and therefore susceptible to saltwater intrusion problems. This study proposes the utilization of a new surrogate model within coupled simulation-optimization (S/O) model for the management of coastal aquifers subjected to density-dependent saltwater intrusion processes. The simulation of the transient 3-dimensional density-dependent flow and transport model is based on the solution of an implemented numerical simulation model. Direct coupling of the numerical simulation model into the multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is computationally expensive. Hence, the solution of the numerical simulation model with random input variables are used to train and test the support vector machine regression (SVMR) surrogate models for approximately simulating the flow and transport processes. The performances of the new surrogate models are evaluated using various performance evaluation criteria. The resulting validated SVMR surrogate models are coupled to the MOGA and implemented for an illustrative coastal aquifer with an aim to develop efficient coastal aquifer management strategies. Based on the objective functions, execution of S/O model presented a set of optimal groundwater withdrawal rates from the simulated aquifer. It also ensured salinity levels at the designated monitoring wells are constrained within specified limits. The efficiency of the new SVMR surrogate models is also demonstrated. Evaluation results suggested that the projected S/O model is an effective way of developing feasible and reliable coastal aquifer management strategies. It also enhances the possibility of solving more realistic large-scale problems and developing regional-scale coastal aquifer management methodologies. © Int. J. of GEOMATE.},

abstract={Most management problems addressed by simulation studies can be characterized as complex and difficult to analyze. Simplification is instrumental in creating and employing simulation models that are useful - by focusing on those system elements that matter, and feasible - by reducing study efforts. Although simplification is considered a fundamental modelling activity, simulation educational support for mastering associated modelling skills is limited. Main textbooks either do not address this topic or tend to restrict their guidance to a few rules of thumb. This reflects how the topic of simulation model simplification is underdeveloped, despite the field of simulation being around 50 years of age. The purpose of this panel is to initiate a discussion about the way we teach simulation model simplification with the view to identifying improvements. This paper addresses the motivation for the panel, and presents panelists' “positions” about the way forward for education on simulation model simplification. © 2018 IEEE},

abstract={To assess the influence of sampling methods on surrogate models' accuracy, using two test problems and a nitrobenzene-contaminated aquifer remediation problem, several sampling methods were adopted to collect sample data sets and a Kriging method was adopted to construct surrogate models. The sampling methods adopted include Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), space-filling-based LHS (SFLHS), orthogonal-array-based LHS (OALHS), and space-filling and orthogonal-array-based LHS (SFOALHS). The space-filling properties and orthogonality of sampling results, as well as the corresponding surrogate models' accuracies, were compared, and the best surrogate model was invoked for assessing the remediation efficiency in a groundwater remediation optimization problem. The results indicated that (1) compared with LHS, SFLHS, and OALHS results, the SFOALHS result had the best trade-off between orthogonality and space-filling property, and better represented the population; and (2) the SFOALHS-based surrogate model was more accurate and better fit the simulation model in both test problems and the case study; therefore it was invoked as a constraint condition for replacing the behavior of the computational simulation model in the optimization process. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Surrogate modeling is becoming a popular tool to approximate computationally-expensive simulations for complex engineering problems. In practice, there are still difficulties in surrogate modeling as follows: (1) efficient learning for functional relationship of simulation models and (2) diagnostics for the surrogate model. In order to address these difficulties simultaneously, this paper proposes a new sequential surrogate modeling by integrating a Compositional Kernel Learning (CKL) method for Gaussian process into a sequential sampling strategy termed the Progressive Latin Hypercube Sampling (PLHS). The CKL enables efficient learning capability for complex response surfaces based on richly structured kernels, while the PLHS sequentially generates nested samples by maintaining desired properties for distribution. Furthermore, this sequential sampling framework allows users to monitor the diagnostics of the surrogate model and assess the stopping criteria for further sampling. In order to demonstrate useful features of the proposed method, nine test functions were assembled for numerical experiments to cover different types of problems (i.e., scale and complexity). The proposed method was evaluated with a set of surrogate modeling techniques and sampling methods in terms of performance, diagnostics and computational cost. The results show that (1) the proposed method can learn various response surfaces with fewer training samples than other methods; and (2) the proposed method only provides a reliable diagnostic measure for global accuracy over different types of problems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This project combines surrogate modeling, a supervised machine learning technique, to bypass whole building energy simulations to enable multi-objective design optimization. We applied this method to identify Pareto optimal retrofit designs that are energy and cost effective for three residential apartments in Lisbon, Portugal. As part of our validation of this approach, we compared the surrogate model error for these Pareto optimal designs to the error in the rest of the design space when compared to a detailed energy simulation. Surrogate model error is higher towards the minimum and maximum energy consumption within the Pareto optimal designs compared to the rest of the design space. We also find that in the Pareto optimal set some design variable values are near their minimum or maximum value, which could be driving higher surrogate model error. We propose that future research should retrain the surrogate model after identifying design variable values of interest from an initial optimization run. © 2019 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

abstract={Surrogate models are increasingly required for applications in which first-principles simulation models are prohibitively expensive to employ for uncertainty analysis, design, or control. They can also be used to approximate models whose discontinuous derivatives preclude the use of gradient-based optimization or data assimilation algorithms. We consider the problem of inferring the 2D location and intensity of a radiation source in an urban environment using a ray-tracing model based on Boltzmann transport theory. Whereas the code implementing this model is relatively efficient, extension to 3D Monte Carlo transport simulations precludes subsequent Bayesian inference to infer source locations, which typically requires thousands to millions of simulations. Additionally, the resulting likelihood exhibits discontinuous derivatives due to the presence of buildings. To address these issues, we discuss the construction of surrogate models for optimization, Bayesian inference, and uncertainty propagation. Specifically, we consider surrogate models based on Legendre polynomials, multivariate adaptive regression splines, radial basis functions, Gaussian processes, and neural networks. We detail strategies for computing training points and discuss the merits and deficits of each method. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Silicon-based lithium ion battery anodes are attracting considerable attention due to their high theoretical capacity. However, the significant volume change of silicon during lithiation/de-lithiation cycles restricts its application. A novel bi-continuous Si anode, designed to mitigate the effect of cycling-induced volume changes, is investigated in this study. The effects of the design parameters and the operating conditions of the anode are explored via multi-physics simulation model. It is found that, with the novel anode structure, battery charging C rate has little impact on the mechanical properties. However, the anode structural design parameters would largely influence the stress distribution on the anode. Thus, a Gaussian Processes (GP) based surrogate model is developed to assist the design optimization of the Si anode, while using the simulated results from a multiphysics simulation model as training data. An optimized Si anode design can then be extracted efficiently based upon the developed surrogate model. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Mechatronics is the synergistic integration of the techniques from mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and information technology, which influences each other mutually. The mechatronic systems are always composed of a number of subsystems with various controllers, and they are large scale systems. The models of large scale systems are always resulted in complex form and high in dimension, making the computation for modeling, simulation and control design become very complicated, or even beyond the solutions provided by conventional engineering methods. Therefore, a simplified model obtained by using model order reduction technique, which can preserve the dominant physical parameters and reveal the performance limiting factor, is preferred. This paper employs a two-wheeled self-balancing scooter as the subject of the study in research on large scale mechatronic system. Efforts have been put on developing a completed mathematical modeling method based on a unified framework from variational method for both mechanical subsystem and electrical subsystem in the scooter. In order to decrease the computation efforts in simulation and control design, Routh model reduction technique was chosen from various model reduction techniques so as to obtain a low dimensional model. Matlab simulation is used to predict the system response based on the simplified model and related control design. Its performance is verified in test runs on the experimental prototype realized with Labview control system. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This study proposes an effective method to robust optimize the vehicle suspension parameters. To implement this method, firstly, a multi-body dynamics model of the suspended monorail vehicle was constructed as a simulation model to obtain the vehicle running stability index. Then, the multi-combination suspension parameters obtained by the orthogonal experimental design method are brought into the simulation model to obtain the training samples of the surrogate model, and the Kriging surrogate model on the vehicle running stability is constructed. Finally, the Taguchi method is used to find the optimal combination of suspension parameters based on the Kriging surrogate model, and the running stability index values of the suspension parameters corresponding to the initial and optimal combinations is compared. The results show that the robust optimization method proposed in this paper improves the lateral and vertical running stability of suspended monorail vehicle by 10.08% and 9.18%, respectively. © 2019, Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

abstract={The L-grass model is a functional-structural model simulating the morphogenesis of perennial grasses above- and belowground. However, due to the high plant density in grasslands and the great number of phytomers and organs to consider over the years, its running time follows a sub-exponential function of the number of iterations. The objective of this study was to build a meta-model of the tiller architectural characteristics (namely the rate of phytomer production and the final dimensions of leaves) able to account for a wide range of genotypes, light competition regimes and management practices (i.e. response to defoliation), while presenting reduced simulation time. Two meta-modelling strategies were compared. The first consisted in "direct" empirical relationships between input parameters and output variables. The second consisted in building a series of "nested" relationships based on intermediate variables that mimicked the L-grass functioning to regulate grass morphogenesis. Our results showed that both strategies were able to accurately reproduce L-grass simulations for independent series of datasets in absence of defoliation (i.e. genotype and light competition effects). However, only the "nested" meta-modelling approach was able to account for the plastic plant response induced by defoliation in terms of leaf size and phyllochron. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Estimation of surrogate models for computer experiments leads to nonparametric regression estimation problems without noise in the dependent variable. In this paper, we propose an empirical maximal deviation minimization principle to construct estimates in this context and analyze the rate of convergence of corresponding quantile estimates. As an application, we consider estimation of computer experiments with moderately high dimension by neural networks and show that here we can circumvent the so-called curse of dimensionality by imposing rather general assumptions on the structure of the regression function. The estimates are illustrated by applying them to simulated data and to a simulation model in mechanical engineering. © 2017, The Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo.},

abstract={In mechanised tunnelling, it is important to perform reliability analyses with respect to the tunnel face collapse and the damage risks of the tunnel lining and existing structures on the ground surface due to the tunnelling induced settlements. The reliability assessment requires to deal with limited information describing the local geology and the soil parameters due to the availability of only a small number of borehole data. In this paper, it is focused on real-time reliability analyses in mechanised tunnelling considering different types of uncertain data, i.e. combining epistemic and aleatoric sources of uncertainty within polymorphic uncertainty models. The system output of interest in these analyses is time variant tunnelling induced surface settlement fields, which are computed by a finite element simulation model. However, for real-time predictions with uncertain data, efficient and reliable surrogate models are required. A new surrogate modelling strategy is developed to predict time variant high dimensional fuzzy settlement fields in real-time. The predicted results of the new surrogate model show similar accuracy compared to the results obtained by optimisation based fuzzy analyses. Meanwhile, the computation time is significantly reduced especially in case of high dimensional outputs and in combination with the p-box approach in the case of polymorphic uncertain data.

abstract={This paper formulates an overall line effectiveness (OLE) improvement scheme for a production line on the basis of Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST) and stochastic Kriging (SK) surrogate model. It is known that improving the key parameters that have great influence on the target performance can bring better effect on the performance than improving other parameters. Thus this paper is concentrated on improving the OLE of a production line through improving multiple key parameters related to the OLE. In the proposed procedure, FAST is used to identify the key parameters for the OLE and a SK surrogate model is built to evaluate the OLE of the production line instead of a simulation model, improving the work efficiency effectively. At last, a comparison with the continuous improvement process (CIP) shows that the scheme formulated with FAST and SK surrogate model is easier to be implemented than the one generated by CIP, because the procedure provided in this paper can give further suggestion to improve the OLE when the improvement of the bottleneck is limited. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={It has been shown that cooperative coevolution (CC) can effectively deal with large scale optimization problems (LSOPs) through a ‘divide-and-conquer’ strategy. However, its performance is severely restricted by the current context-vector-based sub-solution evaluation method, since this method needs to invoke the original high dimensional simulation model when evaluating each sub-solution, thus requiring many computation resources. To alleviate this issue, this study proposes a novel surrogate model assisted cooperative coevolution (SACC) framework. SACC constructs a surrogate model for each sub-problem and employs it to evaluate corresponding sub-solutions. The original simulation model is only adopted to reevaluate a small number of promising sub-solutions selected by surrogate models, and these really evaluated sub-solutions will in turn be employed to update surrogate models. By this means, the computation cost could be greatly reduced without significantly sacrificing evaluation quality. By taking the radial basis function (RBF) and the success-history based adaptive differential evolution (SHADE) as surrogate model and optimizer, respectively, this study further designs a concrete SACC algorithm named RBF-SHADE-SACC. RBF and SHADE have only been proved to be effective on small and medium scale problems. This study scales them up to LSOPs under the SACC framework, where they are tailored to a certain extent for adapting to the characteristics of LSOPs and SACC. Empirical studies on IEEE CEC 2010 benchmark functions demonstrate that SACC can significantly enhance the sub-solution evaluation efficiency, and even with much fewer computation resources, RBF-SHADE-SACC can find much better solutions than traditional CC algorithms. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Surrogate-based simulation-optimization techniques are widely applied in developing optimal remediation strategies that increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of surfactant-enhanced aquifer remediation (SEAR) when clearing dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). In such processes, there are many uncertainty factors that may greatly affect the optimization outcome of a SEAR strategy selection. However, previous research on this subject rarely incorporates an uncertainty analysis. This paper presents an uncertainty analysis of both the simulation model and the ensemble surrogate model used to optimize SEAR strategies. Set pair analysis (SPA) and kriging methods were used to build the ensemble surrogate model. The probability distributions of the residuals of the outputs between the ensemble surrogate model and the simulation model, run on 100 testing samples, were analyzed to ascertain the uncertainty of the surrogate model, which was found to be less than 1.5%. The uncertainty of the simulation model was derived by combining a Monte Carlo random simulation with the Sobol' global sensitivity analysis. Finally, a stochastic nonlinear programming model was established to compute the optimal remediation strategies for the remediation target under different confidence levels. This research will allow decision makers to more confidently select the optimal remediation strategy for a given scenario by balancing the reliability of model prediction with the cost of the remediation strategy according to the demands of the project. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={With the development of electromagnetic simulation software and affordable hardware, it is allowed for us to complete simulations for EMC purposes. However, simulation demands will be immense when simulations for models with complex structures, especially aircraft components, have to be solved. Hence, it is meaningful to investigate how to minimize the computational demands. One of the solutions to reduce the simulation expense is the simplification for the simulated model. But the simplified model should be guaranteed to provide credible simulation results which do not deviate from the original model apparently. Generally, the difference between the simulation results and experimental data is estimated, or if the experimental conditions are not achieved, the comparison between the simplified model and the original one has to be analyzed, at least. This paper explores the electromagnetic simulation of a turbofan engine encountering lightning strike. With the simplifications of different components on the turbofan engine, the influences on induced currents of engine controller cables are simulated and analyzed based on the transmission-line matrix method. A combining method of components removal and geometric structure simplification is proposed to simplify the whole engine model. Simplified components include compressor, combustion chamber, turbine, and nozzle. The effects of different simplification methods are quantified, and the rationality of the simplified model is verified by simulation analysis. © 2019 Yi-fan Qian et al.},

abstract={With the increasing penetration level of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) generator connected to the grid, an accurate simulation model is required for the dynamic analysis of the PV system. However, the detailed electromagnetic simulation of the large-scale system is complex and the dynamic response capability is estimated with obstacle caused by large computational burdens. Therefore, a precise dynamic aggregated model is indispensable for the displacement of the large-scale PV system. The structure-preservation based aggregated model with comprehensive equivalent parameters for large-scale PV system is proposed in this paper. A complete two-stage PV system model is established to analyze the dynamics of the system. Then, the aggregation method is obtained by comparing the dynamic equations of the detailed model with the aggregated model, which is based on the energy relationship in the PV system. Furthermore, four different case studies are considered including the aggregation of identical and different ten parallel-connected PV units both under the same irradiance condition, and the aggregation of different ten parallel-connected PV units under different irradiance and weak grid scenarios, where the aggregation models are obtained through the proposed equivalent modeling method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed aggregation method is verified by the simulation results from PSCAD/EMTDC platform, and the consistency between the aggregated model and the detailed model is confirmed under different disturbances of irradiance variation, and continuous symmetric and asymmetric grid faults. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers poses significant challenges in the management of vulnerable coastal groundwater resources around the world. To develop a strategy for regional scale sustainable management of coastal aquifers, solution of large-scale multi-objective decision models is essential. The flow and solute transport equations are also density dependent, where the flow parameters are dependent on salt concentration; hence, the flow and solute transport equations need to be solved as coupled equations. In a linked optimization simulation model, the numerical simulation model as a predictor of the physical processes need to be solved enormous number of times to be able to identify an optimum solution as per the specified objectives and constraints. This problem becomes even more complicated when multiple objectives are included and the Pareto optimal solutions need to be determined. Therefore, to ensure the computational efficiency and feasibility of determining a regional scale strategy for control and sustainable use of a coastal aquifer, meta-models that are trained, tested and validated using randomized solutions of the numerical simulation models can be utilized. These meta-models once trained and tested serves the purpose of an approximate emulator of the complex numerical models rendering the solution of a complex and large scale linked optimization model computationally efficient and feasible. The optimal groundwater extraction patterns can be obtained through linked simulation-optimization (S/O) technique in which the simulation part is usually replaced by computationally efficient meta-models. This study proposes a computationally efficient meta-model to emulate density reliant integrated flow and solute transport scenarios of coastal aquifers. A meta-model, Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is trained and developed for an illustrative coastal aquifer study area. Prediction accuracy of the developed ANFIS based meta-model is evaluated for suitability. The meta-model is then integrated with a multiple objective coastal aquifer management model to demonstrate the potential application of this methodology. The optimization algorithm utilized for solution is the Controlled Elitist Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm. Performance evaluation results show acceptable accuracy in the obtained optimized management strategies. Therefore, use of trained and tested meta-models linked to an optimization model results in significant computational efficacy. It also ensures computational practicability of solving such large-scale integrated S/O approach for regional scale coastal groundwater management. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Lithium-ion batteries are widely used as power sources in industrial applications. Electrochemical models and simulations are crucial to disclose many details that cannot be directly measured through experiments. Parameter identification of an accurate electrochemical model is much more cost-effective than direct and destructive measurement methods. However, the complex structure and strong nonlinearity of electrochemical models will make the parameter identification very difficult. Additionally, time-consuming electrochemical simulations can significantly limit the identification efficiency. This paper proposes a surrogate-model-based scheme to achieve high-efficiency parameter identification of an electrochemical battery model. To be specific, the proposed method is implemented by the close integration of an evolutionary algorithm and a surrogate model. A sensitivity-based identification strategy is first designed to alleviate the difficulty of optimization. Then, a surrogate model is developed from historical data to gradually approach the objective function used for parameter evaluations. Finally, an evolutionary algorithm is employed to find promising solutions by minimizing the output of the surrogate model. Simulations and experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness and high efficiency of the proposed method. IEEE},

abstract={To reduce complexity, the combat effectiveness simulation system (CESS) is often decomposed into static structure, physical behavior, and cognitive behavior, and model abstraction is layered onto domain invariant knowledge (DIK) and application variant knowledge (AVK) levels. This study concentrates on the specification of CESS's physical behaviors at the DIK level of abstraction, and proposes a model driven framework for efficiently developing simulation models within model-driven engineering (MDE). Technically, this framework integrates the four-layer meta-modeling architecture and a set of model transformation techniques with the objective of reducing model heterogeneity and enhancing model continuity. As a proof of concept, a torpedo example is illustrated to explain how physical models are developed following the proposed framework. Finally, a combat scenario is constructed to demonstrate the availability, and a further verification is shown by a reasonable agreement between simulation results and field observations. © 1990-2011 Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information.},

In order to study the output characteristics of the wind generator system, the components with small inertia constant in the electromagnetic transient model are neglected, and the shafting model, the converter model, and the control loops are simplified and reduced, respectively. Based on the study of the single electromagnetic transient model of wind generators, the simplified simulation models are built by the PSCAD (Power Systems Computer Aided Design) simulation platform, which are carried out under the conditions of constant wind speed, step wind speed, and fault. The output characteristics of the simplified models under different working conditions are compared in detail models. The simulation results show that, within the allowable calculation accuracy range, the dynamic response curves of the single simplified model and the electromagnetic transient model are consistent. The simulation speed can be significantly improved, the time consumption can be reduced, and the simulation speed can be increased more obviously when the number of simulation models increases. Therefore, it can be applied to the simulation research of multi-wind generators in large-scale wind farms. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={In recent years, the importance of computationally efficient surrogate models has been emphasized as the use of high-fidelity simulation models increases. However, high-dimensional models require a lot of samples for surrogate modeling. To reduce the computational burden in the surrogate modeling, we propose an integrated algorithm that incorporates accurate variable selection and surrogate modeling. One of the main strengths of the proposed method is that it requires less number of samples compared with conventional surrogate modeling methods by excluding dispensable variables while maintaining model accuracy. In the proposed method, the importance of selected variables is evaluated using the quality of the model approximated with the selected variables only. Nonparametric probabilistic regression is adopted as the modeling method to deal with inaccuracy caused by using selected variables during modeling. In particular, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is utilized for the modeling because it is suitable for exploiting its model performance indices in the variable selection criterion. Outstanding variables that result in distinctly superior model performance are finally selected as essential variables. The proposed algorithm utilizes a conservative selection criterion and appropriate sequential sampling to prevent incorrect variable selection and sample overuse. Performance of the proposed algorithm is verified with two test problems with challenging properties such as high dimension, nonlinearity, and the existence of interaction terms. A numerical study shows that the proposed algorithm is more effective as the fraction of dispensable variables is high. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={New applications that can exploit emerging exascale computing resources efficiently, while providing meaningful scientific results, are eagerly anticipated. Multi-scale models, especially multi-scale applications, will assuredly run at the exascale. We have established that a class of multi-scale applications implementing the heterogeneous multi-scale model follows, a heterogeneous multi-scale computing (HMC) pattern, which typically features a macroscopic model synchronising numerous independent microscopic model simulations. Consequently, communication between microscopic simulations is limited. Furthermore, a surrogate model can often be introduced between macro-scale and micro-scale models to interpolate required data from previously computed micro-scale simulations, thereby substantially reducing the number of micro-scale simulations. Nonetheless, HMC applications, though versatile, remain constrained by load balancing issues. We discuss two main issues: the a priori unknown and variable execution time of microscopic simulations, and the dynamic number of micro-scale simulations required. We tackle execution time variability using a pilot job mechanism to handle internal queuing and multiple sub-model execution on large-scale supercomputers, together with a data-informed execution time prediction model. To dynamically select the number of micro-scale simulations, the HMC pattern automatically detects and identifies three surrogate model phases that help control the available and used core amount. After relevant phase detection and micro-scale simulation scheduling, any idle cores can be used for surrogate model update or for processor release back to the system. We demonstrate HMC performance by testing it on two representative multi-scale applications. We conclude that, considering the subtle interplay between the macroscale model, surrogate models and micro-scale simulations, HMC provides a promising path towards exascale for many multiscale applications. © The Authors 2019.},

On the basis of this examination, a parametric model was developed for double-O-rings without gaps, which are suitable for hydraulic cylinder sealing. Suitable design variables, objective functions, and constraint conditions were determined for the parametric model. Then, a surrogate model was fitted and optimised through a constrained Latin hypercube method, an interpolating recmultiquadric radial basis function method, and the genetic algorithm. The results indicate that the seal and seal groove structures obtained through optimisation with the surrogate model provide a superior sealing effect to unoptimised structures. Therefore, the combination of the developed surrogate model and finite-element method can provide a theoretical reference for the design of the sealing structure of hydraulic cylinders. © 2020 Hong Zhang et al.},

abstract={Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) is an active field of research that combines reliability analysis and optimization techniques. The early RBDO techniques were limited in applications because of the approximation techniques (FORM) used in the reliability part. More sophisticated techniques that rely on simulations were not of practical interest until the recent introduction of surrogate modeling to the field of structural reliability. Many approaches that couple surrogate modeling, simulation-based reliability analysis and optimization for the solution of RBDO problems have been recently developed. This paper proposes a global and unified framework for surrogate-assisted RBDO that allows for the solution of various types of RBDO formulations. This framework is built using three distinct and independent blocks which are coupled non-intrusively. To enhance the overall efficiency, the surrogate models are built adaptively in a single augmented space prior to starting optimization. The proposed framework is illustrated using different techniques in each of the three blocks. © 13th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering, ICASP 2019.

abstract={Computational human factors tools are often not fully-integrated during the early phases of product design. Often, conventional ergonomic practices require physical prototypes and human subjects which are costly in terms of finances and time. Ergonomics evaluations executed on physical prototypes has the limitations of increasing the overall rework as more iterations are required to incorporate design changes related to human factors that are found later in the design stage, which affects the overall cost of product development. This paper proposes a design methodology based on Digital Human Modeling (DHM) approach to inform designers about the ergonomics adequacies of products during early stages of design process. This proactive ergonomics approach has the potential to allow designers to identify significant design variables that affect the human performance before full-scale prototypes are built. The design method utilizes a surrogate model that represents human product interaction. Optimizing the surrogate model provides design concepts to optimize human performance. The efficacy of the proposed design method is demonstrated by a cockpit design study. Copyright © 2018 ASME.},

abstract={In urban metro systems, several factors such as passenger congestion may affect the movement of trains, resulting in significant deviations from the planned timetable. This study proposes a meta-model simulation-based optimization approach for minimizing the passenger wait time under random disturbances. The modeling framework is based on a hybrid discrete-event simulation and response surface methodology (RSM), thereby capturing the benefits of both methods. The verification process is handled using the calculation of second-order derivate along with an Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Simulation meta-data that is most consistent with the data collected from simulation experiments are used to describe the relationship between response variables, i.e., average waiting time per passenger, and input variable, i.e., time intervals between two departures. The optimal parameters of the RSM are decided using a factorial design. The validity of the results is confirmed using the real instances of a high-speed rail transit line. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Classical numerical techniques remain very computationally expensive to model the magnetization of twisted multifilamentary superconductors in three dimensions because they require solving a large system of equations. In this paper, a reduced model is proposed to approximate the ac losses of these types of wires. It is established through the projection of the physical problem in a helical Frenet basis and the use of periodic boundary conditions on a slice of the wire. The reduced model on the slice leads to systems of more reasonable size leading to smaller and faster simulations than when the whole wire is modeled. Simulation results show that the proposed method leads to computed losses similar to those obtained on a whole wire. Several simulation cases are proposed to prove the validity of the proposed model, and a comparison to some ac loss measurements is proposed to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The implementation relies on the H-formulation and is solved with the open-source solver, Getdp. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The increasing complexity of the interconnected power system makes high-fidelity dynamic simulation models computationally more intensive. To improve computation efficiency, model reduction techniques have been investigated to only preserve the dynamics in a limited area of interest (study area), while deriving equivalent representation for the external area. For this purpose, a measurement-based reduction approach using system identification techniques has been previously proposed. In that case, external areas are represented by dynamic equivalent loads using transfer function estimation. In this paper, in order to enhance the accuracy of the reduced model in preserving dynamics of the study area, multiple “grid” events of different types and at different locations are considered for identifying the parameters of the equivalent loads. Case studies are carried out in the NPCC 140-bus system. Comparisons are made between multiple events training and single event training, highlighting the advantages of the proposed method in providing a better representation of the grid dynamics under different operating conditions. © 2020},

abstract={On the basis of ensuring insulation and current carrying capacity, set the electric field and temperature as constraints, the GIS/GIL co-simulation model was established with the least cost as the optimization goal. The optimization process usually requires hundreds of iterative calculations, which resulted in inefficiency of the complex and time-consuming 2D/3D co-simulation model and difficulties of meeting the needs of product development. Firstly, cosimulation models of static electric field, eddy current and dynamic fluid were established. Then using the Latin hypercube sampling method, 50 samples were extracted from the optimized sample space, and the sensitivity analysis was performed based on the results of co-simulation model. Based on the sensitivity analysis results, the simplified model was established by using the least squares fitting method. The simplified model results are verified by co-simulation model. The results showed that calculation consistency of simplified model with co-simulation model is about 98.9%, while the computational efficiency of the simplified model is 4000 times that of the co-simulation model. After optimization, the busbar cost is reduced by 26.65% on the basis of ensuring insulation and current-carrying performance. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents the analysis of a simplified model for the design of a module structure that avoids the risk of self-excited oscillation (SE-Osc). A necessary and sufficient simplified model that can extract the critical oscillation mode is proposed based on a comparison of several simplifying steps. The differential equation of the simplified model is solved, and the solution is plotted in the frequency domain to analyze the oscillatory conditions. The simplified model is verified via a time-domain full-model simulation modeled by 3-D electromagnetic simulation and solved by finite-element simulation. Measurements of test modules show consistent oscillatory conditions and frequency. SE-Osc modes are eliminated by reducing the inductance connected to the emitter and increasing the inductance connected to the collector. Increasing the ratio of CCE to CGC increases the risk of self-exciting oscillation. Suppressions of SE-Osc from a common package design with state-of-the-art Si-insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) presenting small feedback capacitance, SiC-MOS, and hybrids of state-of-art Si-IGBTs and SiC-Schottky barrier diodes are verified. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to analyze the influence of the uncertainty of the parameters on the output results of the surface water and groundwater coupled simulation model, this paper uses the Monte Carlo method to analyze the uncertainty of the surface water and groundwater coupling simulation model, and carries out the risk assessment on the basis of the results of uncertainty analysis. In this paper, the coupling simulation model of surface water and groundwater is established by taking the water catchment of the Yin Ma River in the upper reaches of the Shitoukoumen Reservoir as example, and the HydroGeosphere (HGS) software is used to solve the model. Local sensitivity analysis method is used to identify the parameters with high sensitivity in the coupled simulation model as random variables. Then the Monte Carlo method is applied to analyze the uncertainty of the simulation model. In order to reduce the computational load in the process of uncertainty analysis, a surrogate model of simulation model is established by using Kriging method. The results show that the most sensitive parameters in the coupling model of surface water and groundwater are hydraulic conductivity, porosity and Manning roughness coefficient. The Kriging surrogate model can significantly reduce the computation load under certain accuracy. The risk assessment results show that the risk probability of groundwater ecological environment deterioration is 6%, and the probability of surface water environment deterioration is 15%. © 2018, China Water Power Press.

abstract={As parallel computing becomes increasingly important in many real-world applications, a batch sequential experimental design (BSED), which adds a batch of computer experiments per iteration and runs these simulations in parallel, is gaining popularity in surrogate modeling. This article proposes sequential online dispatch in design of experiments (SODDE) for single-and multiple-response surrogate modeling when multiple processors work in parallel but not independently. The proposed method includes several unique features: 1) it works with any popular acquisition function to select a single new sample point at each iteration; 2) it minimizes the idle time of all processors; 3) it rapidly updates the surrogate model; and 4) it dynamically reconstructs the surrogate model when a simulation process aborts, minimizing the impact incurred by the abortion. The effectiveness of SODDE is evaluated in one mathematical example and one industrial problem. The latter problem considers blade design of horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs). The cost of finding blade geometry that results in the desired aerodynamic behavior of HAWTs is estimated for BSED and SODDE. Relative to BSED, SODDE reduces the costs by up to approximately 31%. Note to Practitioners-Computer simulation models are often used to represent the behavior of complex engineered systems, such as automobiles, aircraft, and wind turbines. Although running computer simulations allows analyzing the performance of these systems, the simulations can still be computationally costly (e.g., hours of runtime for numerically solving a large number of differential equations in one simulation), which makes the performance analysis task challenging. It is important to design an innovative simulation process that replaces the original expensive simulation models by cheap-To-build surrogate models, and at the same time, minimize the computational costs for building the surrogate models. The new method developed in this article allows experimental designers to run batch sequential iterations and run these iterations in parallel. This, in engineering practice, will help meet the need for long and complex experimental designs scenarios in a parallel computing environment, where the computer 'up time' (or runtime) needs to be maximized to save time and ultimately, money. Cost analysis results from an industrial problem involving the inverse design of wind turbine blades suggest that the proposed method reduces the computational costs by up to approximately 31% over an existing method. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={When dealing with reservoir production optimization problems with many variables, directly using surrogate model may deteriorate the optimization results. In this study, a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm based on principal component analysis was proposed for production optimization. Surrogate model is a mathematical model that is computationally fast with an accuracy close to the original numerical simulation model. The principal component analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and then it was optimized by using a differential evolutionary algorithm based on the surrogate model. Consequently, the optimal control scheme of an actual production optimization problem was obtained, and the Egg model was adopted to test the proposed method via the SADE-PCA method. The results show that the proposed surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm based on principal component analysis can effectively reduce the dimension of variables and solve large-scale production optimization of reservoirs efficiently. The optimized injection-production control scheme can effectively increase cumulative oil production and reduce water production to improve the economic benefits of oilfields. In addition, the interpolation control method (ICM) has great performance in achieving smooth control schemes and improving calculation efficiency. © 2020, Editorial Office of Journal of China University of Petroleum(Edition of Natural Science).

abstract={Fast multi-objective design optimization of antenna structures is discussed using variable-fidelity simulation models and kriging surrogates. The cost of surrogate model construction is significantly reduced by constraining the model domain to a simplex spanned by the extreme Pareto-optimal designs, further extended in orthogonal directions so as to enclose the entire Pareto front. For demonstration purposes, a UWB monopole is designed for size minimization, matching improvement and reduction of realized gain variations. A uniform representation of the Pareto set is obtained at the cost of only 195 high-fidelity EM simulations of the antenna, which is 64-percent speedup as compared to the benchmark surrogate-assisted technique. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Optimisation of manufacturing process parameters requires resource-intensive search in a high-dimensional parameter space. In some cases, physics-based simulations can replace actual experiments. But they are computationally expensive to evaluate. Surrogate-based optimisation uses a simplified model to guide the search for optimised parameter combinations, where the surrogate model is iteratively improved with new observations. This work applies surrogate-based optimisation to a composite textile draping process. Numerical experiments are conducted with a Finite Element (FE) simulation model. The surrogate model, a deep artificial neural network, is trained to predict the shear angle of more than 24,000 textile elements. Predicting detailed process results instead of a single performance scalar improves the model quality, as more relevant data from every experiment can be used for training. For the textile draping case, the approach is shown to reduce the number of resource-intensive FE simulations required to find optimised parameter configurations. It also improves on the best-known overall solution. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={High dimensionality continues to be a challenge in computational systems biology. The kinetic models of many phenomena of interest are high-dimensional and complex, resulting in large computational effort in the simulation. Model order reduction (MOR) is a mathematical technique that is used to reduce the computational complexity of high-dimensional systems by approximation with lower dimensional systems, while retaining the important information and properties of the full order system. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is a method based on Galerkin projection that can be used for reducing the model order. POD is considered an optimal linear approach since it obtains the minimum squared distance between the original model and its reduced representation. However, POD may represent a restriction for nonlinear systems. By applying the POD method for nonlinear systems, the complexity to solve the nonlinear term still remains that of the full order model. To overcome the complexity for nonlinear terms in the dynamical system, an approach called the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) can be used. In this paper, we discuss model reduction by POD and DEIM to reduce the order of kinetic models of biological systems and illustrate the approaches on some examples. Additional computational costs for setting up the reduced order system pay off for large-scale systems. In general, a reduced model should not be expected to yield good approximations if different initial conditions are used from that used to produce the reduced order model. We used the POD method of a kinetic model with different initial conditions to compute the reduced model. This reduced order model is able to predict the full order model for a variety of different initial conditions. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Simulation optimization is often conducted by applying optimization heuristics (e.g., genetic algorithms) whereby the simulation model delivers the objective function value for the respective parameter set. For real world simulation models, their evaluation time is a crucial constraint. This holds especially for material requirements planning (MRP) parameter optimization of real production systems with many products, because of an extensive search space. Approximating the objective function values by surrogate models can be applied to reduce the search space. Based on a real world production system simulation model, the performance of different regression models to identify simple surrogate models for fast objective function approximation is evaluated in this paper. Specifically, a focus is put on the relationship between the MRP parameters: lot-size and planned lead time, and the performance indicators: inventory and tardiness costs. The paper evaluates a set of simple regression models and compares their objective function fit. © 2018 IEEE},

abstract={Modular multilevel converter (MMC) has outstanding advantages in the application of new energy transmission, island power supply, and etc, adopted in more and more applications. Due to the large number of sub-modules in MMC, the electromagnetic transient simulation is difficult and time-consuming, which increases the difficulty of design and optimization of MMC and the stability analysis of power system with MMC. Therefore, an accurate and efficient simulation model should be established to analyze the system in different operation conditions. In this paper, based on the operation-mode of the MMC sub-module, a working mode of the MMC bridge arm was analyzed. And then, an equivalent aggregated model was derived for system-level analysis. Finally, a 49-level MMC detailed electromagnetic transient model and its equivalent aggregation model were built in PSCAD/EMTDC. The dynamic processes of the two models in the startup, operation and fault of VSC-HVDC were compared. The results show that the proposed MMC aggregation model can accurately simulate system-level behavior of MMC under various working conditions. © 2020, Editorial Department of Transaction of Beijing Institute of Technology.

abstract={Full scale aerodynamic wind tunnel testing, numerical simulation of high dimensional (full-order) aerodynamic models or flight testing are some of the fundamental but complex steps in the various design phases of recent civil transport aircrafts. Current aircraft aerodynamic designs have increase in complexity (multidisciplinary, multi-objective or multi-fidelity) and need to address the challenges posed by the nonlinearity of the objective functions and constraints, uncertainty quantification in aerodynamic problems or the restrained computational budgets. With the aim to reduce the computational burden and generate low-cost but accurate models that mimic those full order models at different values of the design variables, Recent progresses have witnessed the introduction, in real-time and many-query analyses, of surrogate-based approaches as rapid and cheaper to simulate models. In this paper, a comprehensive and state-of-the art survey on common surrogate modeling techniques and surrogate-based optimization methods is given, with an emphasis on models selection and validation, dimensionality reduction, sensitivity analyses, constraints handling or infill and stopping criteria. Benefits, drawbacks and comparative discussions in applying those methods are described. Furthermore, the paper familiarizes the readers with surrogate models that have been successfully applied to the general field of fluid dynamics, but not yet in the aerospace industry. Additionally, the review revisits the most popular sampling strategies used in conducting physical and simulation-based experiments in aircraft aerodynamic design. Attractive or smart designs infrequently used in the field and discussions on advanced sampling methodologies are presented, to give a glance on the various efficient possibilities to a priori sample the parameter space. Closing remarks foster on future perspectives, challenges and shortcomings associated with the use of surrogate models by aircraft industrial aerodynamicists, despite their increased interest among the research communities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper introduces performance-informed design space exploration (DSE) to question the relationship between explicit, quantitative optimization problems and “wicked”, co-evolving architectural design problems and to support the reframing of architectural design optimization as a medium for reflection. The paper proposes selection, refinement, and understanding as key aspects of performance-informed DSE and surveys current approaches to performance-informed DSE: (1) Clustering and Pareto-based optimization support selection by reducing large numbers of parametric design candidates into smaller and more meaningful sets of choices. (2) Surrogate modelling supports refinement by approximating time-intensive simulations in real-time, which is important for interactivity. (3) Multi-variate visualizations and statistical analyses support understanding by providing insights into characteristics of design spaces and fitness landscapes. Finally, the paper discusses a novel tool for visual and interactive, performance-informed DSE, Performance Explorer. Performance Explorer combines the real-time feedback afforded by surrogate models with a multi-variate visualization of fitness landscapes. A user test of Performance Explorer uncovered several performanceinformed DSE strategies followed by the participants. Consisting of different combinations of selection, refinement, and understanding, these strategies illustrate and—to some extent—validate the proposed framework for performance-informed DSE. © 2019 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

abstract={Design of high-frequency structures, including microwave and antenna components, heavily relies on full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation models. Their reliability comes at a price of a considerable computational cost. This may lead to practical issues whenever numerous EM analyses are to be executed, e.g., in the case of parametric optimization. The difficulties entailed by massive simulations may be mitigated by the use of fast surrogates, among which data-driven models are the most popular ones due to their versatility and accessibility. Unfortunately, conventional modeling techniques are significantly affected by the curse of dimensionality. It is particularly restrictive in the case of high-frequency components, typically exhibiting highly nonlinear characteristics. Recently, the concept of performance-driven modeling has been proposed where the surrogate model setup is focused on a small subset of the parameter space, containing the designs that are optimal or nearly optimal with respect to the considered performance figures. Domain confinement allows for a dramatic reduction of the number of training data samples needed for rendering reliable surrogates valid over wide ranges of the system parameters. In this paper, we review some of the recent techniques employing these concepts, discuss their properties, and illustrate them using real-world examples of antenna and microwave components. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract={A surrogate modelling strategy for predictions of interval settlement fields in real time during machine driven construction of tunnels, accounting for uncertain geotechnical parameters in terms of intervals, is presented in the paper. Artificial Neural Network and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition approaches are combined to approximate and predict tunnelling induced time variant surface settlement fields computed by a process-oriented finite element simulation model. The surrogate models are generated, trained and tested in the design (offline) stage of a tunnel project based on finite element analyses to compute the surface settlements for selected scenarios of the tunnelling process steering parameters taking uncertain geotechnical parameters by means of possible ranges (intervals) into account. The resulting mappings of time constant geotechnical interval parameters and time variant deterministic steering parameters onto the time variant interval settlement field are solved offline by optimisation and online by interval analyses approaches using the midpoint-radius representation of interval data. During the tunnel construction, the surrogate model is designed to be used in real-time to predict interval fields of the surface settlements in each stage of the advancement of the tunnel boring machine for selected realisations of the steering parameters to support the steering decisions of the machine driver. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This work presents a new bi-fidelity model reduction approach to the inverse problem under the framework of Bayesian inference. A low-rank approximation is introduced to the solution of the corresponding forward problem and admits a variable-separation form in terms of stochastic basis functions and physical basis functions. The calculation of stochastic basis functions is computationally predominant for the low-rank expression. To significantly improve the efficiency of constructing the low-rank approximation, we propose a bi-fidelity model reduction based on a novel variable-separation method, where a low-fidelity model is used to compute the stochastic basis functions and a high-fidelity model is used to compute the physical basis functions. The low-fidelity model has lower accuracy but efficient to evaluate compared with the high-fidelity model; it accelerates the derivative of recursive formulation for the stochastic basis functions. The high-fidelity model is computed in parallel for a few samples scattered in the stochastic space when we construct the high-fidelity physical basis functions. The required number of forward model simulations in constructing the basis functions is very limited. The bi-fidelity model can be constructed efficiently while retaining good accuracy simultaneously. In the proposed approach, both the stochastic basis functions and physical basis functions are calculated using the model information. This implies that a few basis functions may accurately represent the model solution in high-dimensional stochastic spaces. The bi-fidelity model reduction is applied to Bayesian inverse problems to accelerate posterior exploration. A few numerical examples in time-fractional derivative diffusion models are carried out to identify the smooth field and channel-structured field in porous media in the framework of Bayesian inverse problems. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The nested-simulation is commonly used for calculating the predictive distribution of the total variable annuity (VA) liabilities of large VA portfolios. Due to the large numbers of policies, inner-loops and outer-loops, running the nested-simulation for a large VA portfolio is extremely time consuming and often prohibitive. In this paper, the use of surrogate models is incorporated into the nested-simulation algorithm so that the relationship between the inputs and the outputs of a simulation model is approximated by various statistical models. As a result, the nested-simulation algorithm can be run with much smaller numbers of different inputs. Specifically, a spline regression model is used to reduce the number of outer-loops and a model-assisted finite population estimation framework is adapted to reduce the number of policies in use for the nested-simulation. From simulation studies, our proposed algorithm is able to accurately approximate the predictive distribution of the total VA liability at a significantly reduced running time. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Complex computational models are often designed to simulate real-world physical phenomena in many scientific disciplines. However, these simulation models tend to be computationally very expensive and involve a large number of simulation input parameters, which need to be analyzed and properly calibrated before the models can be applied for real scientific studies. We propose a visual analysis system to facilitate interactive exploratory analysis of high-dimensional input parameter space for a complex yeast cell polarization simulation. The proposed system can assist the computational biologists, who designed the simulation model, to visually calibrate the input parameters by modifying the parameter values and immediately visualizing the predicted simulation outcome without having the need to run the original expensive simulation for every instance. Our proposed visual analysis system is driven by a trained neural network-based surrogate model as the backend analysis framework. In this work, we demonstrate the advantage of using neural networks as surrogate models for visual analysis by incorporating some of the recent advances in the field of uncertainty quantification, interpretability and explainability of neural network-based models. We utilize the trained network to perform interactive parameter sensitivity analysis of the original simulation as well as recommend optimal parameter configurations using the activation maximization framework of neural networks. We also facilitate detail analysis of the trained network to extract useful insights about the simulation model, learned by the network, during the training process. We performed two case studies, and discovered multiple new parameter configurations, which can trigger high cell polarization results in the original simulation model. We evaluated our results by comparing with the original simulation model outcomes as well as the findings from previous parameter analysis performed by our experts. © 1995-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a reduced model based on position based dynamics for real-time simulation of human musculature. We demonstrate our methods on the muscles of the human arm. Co-simulation of all the muscles of the human arm allow us to accurately track the development of stresses and strains in the muscles, when the arm is moved. We evaluate our method for accuracy by comparing it with gold standard simulation models based on finite volume methods, and demonstrate the stability of the method under flexion, extension and torsion. © 2018 ACM.},

abstract={Production planning optimization remains a major challenge in almost all industries, particularly in high-tech manufacturing. A critical task to support such optimization is performance evaluation, wherein an accurate estimation of the cycle time as a function of the throughput rate plays a key role. This paper develops a novel aggregation model based on a queueing network approach, so-called queue-based aggregation (QAG) model, to estimate the cycle time of a job-shop production system that consists of several processing workstations, and in which products are transferred via an Automated Material Handling System (AMHS). The proposed model aggregates both production and automated material handling systems and provides an accurate and fast estimation of the overall cycle time. The performance and superiority of the proposed model is validated by comparing its results with those of a detailed simulation model. Numerous sensitivity analyses are performed to provide valuable managerial insights on both the production and automated material handling systems. © 2019},

abstract={Woven composites possess multiple inherent uncertainty sources, which leads to the stochasticity of macroscopic mechanical properties. In this work, a multiscale approach is proposed to quantify the uncertainty of macroscopic elastic properties and strengths of three-dimensional orthogonal woven composites. Multiple experimentally quantified uncertainty sources arising from microscale, mesoscale and macro scale are introduced in the multiscale simulation process. In each scale, a series of Statistical Volume Element models involving intra-scale uncertainty sources are constructed to characterize the probability distributions of output mechanical properties. The obtained probabilistic-based mechanical properties in lower scale are converted to high scale by statistical uncertainty propagation methods. Dedicated codes for generating simulation models and statistical techniques (e.g. surrogate models) are implemented to alleviate the manual labor and computational cost of multiscale simulations. The stochasticity of macroscopic properties predicted by the proposed multiscale approach agrees well with the experimental results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Real-time reliability analyses of mechanized tunneling processes can help to reduce the risk of tunneling induced damages and failures. In order to support the machine driver to steer the tunnel boring machine, fast simulation models are required. In this work, polymorphic uncertainty modeling approaches are combined with numerical surrogate models to provide reliability measures in real-time during tunnel construction.

abstract={Computational cost plays a major role in the performance of scientific and engineering simulation. This in turn makes the virtual validation process complex and time consuming. In the simulation process, achievement of appropriate level of accurate models as close as physical testing is the root for increase in the computational cost. During preliminary phase of product development, it is difficult to identify the appropriate size, shape and other parameters of the component and they will undergo several modifications in concept and other stages. An approximation model called metamodel or surrogate model has developed for reducing these effects and minimizing the computational cost. Metamodel can be used in the place of actual simulation models. Metamodel can be an algorithm or a mathematical relation representing the relations between input and output parameters. The scope of this paper is to generate approximate models (metamodels) for the automotive wheel with help of response surface methodology (RSM) using Isight commercial tool and to arrive at the optimum shape, size and weight of the wheels by considering all necessary loading conditions. The proposed metamodel concept used for the two different load cases, (i) Wheel crush simulation (ii) Wheel modal analysis. This paper describes about the metamodel generation using the validated wheel crush simulation results for various wheel samples. This study gives an insight on how the metamodel helps the designer in selecting the optimum design parameters for the specific load and in the estimation of the maximum crush load for given design parameters. The same metamodel concept using RSM also extended for the prediction of wheel modal performance i.e., to achieve the desired wheel natural frequency target with the optimum size, shape and weight of the wheel, metamodel is used. This concept substantially reduces the time and effort during initial phase of wheel design. © 2020 FCA US LLC.},

abstract={In this work, a wind farm aggregation method for electromagnetic simulation model based on FDNE is proposed. Identical subsystems terminated with a same node operating in parallel can be aggregated with the same constraints. WTGs connected to the same feeder within a wind farm can be aggregated as one equivalent subsystem. And the wind farm aggregated model includes several aggregated subsystems based on the grouping criterion. And each aggregated subsystem model constitutes an aggregated WTG with a current amplifier to generate the same amount of real power, an equivalent impedance of collector system, and a FDNE component to adjust the aggregated model frequency characteristics. Wind farms based on DFIG and PMSG are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed aggregation method. The simulation comparison results indicate that the proposed method can guarantee the consistencies of the power flow and transient responses during faults with high accuracy. And the computation time is shortened by 87% in the dome cases. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Embedding simulation models developed during the design of a platform opens a lot of potential new functionalities but requires additional certification. Usually, these models require too much computing power, take too much time to run so we need to build an approximation of these models that can be compatible with operational constraints, hardware constraints, and real-time constraints. Also, we need to prove that the decisions made by the system using the surrogate model instead of the reference one will be safe. The confidence in its safety has to be demonstrated to certification authorities. In cases where safety can be ensured by systematically overestimating the reference model, we propose different probabilistic safety bounds that we apply on a braking distance use-case.We also derive a new loss function suited for shifted surrogates and study the influence of the different confidence parameters on the trade-off between the safety and accuracy of the surrogate models. Here are the main contributions and the outline of this paper: • We define safety as the fact that a surrogate model should over-estimate the reference model with high probability. • We use Bernstein-type deviation inequalities to estimate the probability of under-estimating a reference model with a surrogate model. • We show how to shift a surrogate to guarantee safeness with high probability. • Since shifting impacts the performance of our surrogate, we derive a new regression loss function-that we call SMSE-in order to build surrogates with safenesspromoting constraints. © 2020 for this paper by its authors.},

abstract={Space mapping (SM) belongs to the most successful surrogate-based optimization (SBO) methods in microwave engineering. Among available SM variations, implicit SM (ISM) is particularly attractive due to its simplicity and separation of extractable surrogate model parameters and design variables of the circuit/system at hand. Unlike other SM approaches, ISM exploits a set of preassigned parameters to align the surrogate with the high-fidelity EM model. However, application of ISM is challenging if equivalent network model of the structure is unavailable or of poor quality. In this letter, a modified ISM that exploits variable-fidelity EM simulation models is proposed. Here, preassigned parameters are introduced in the coarsely discretized EM surrogate by dividing the substrate below selected components of the structure into segments with different permittivity and common thickness. The proposed method has been verified (also experimentally) using a rat-race coupler and favorably compared with state-of-the-art SBO methods. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={A finite element based computational model simulating the standard drop tower test for military helmets was created and used in conjunction with a multi-output Gaussian process surrogate to seek different designs of helmets for improved blunt impact performance. Experimental drop test results were used for the validation of the model’s ability to simulate impact. The influence of foam stiffness, impact velocity, strap tension, as well as pad placement and size on parameters on the peak linear acceleration (PLA) of the headform was investigated for the first time through a surrogate model trained by strategically choosing simulation points. Impact velocity was found to have the greatest effect. The strap tension and foam pad stiffness ranges examined within this sampling plan were found to have less of an effect on the performance of the helmet than the pad size and shape parameters examined. The surrogate modeling approach was used to quantify the influence of design parameters and can lead to not only improved helmet designs but also new data-driven design metrics and testing standards to accelerate the development of TBI-mitigating helmets. © IMechE 2020.},

abstract={For affine linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems, this paper develops two parameter reduction methods for reducing the dimension of the parameter space. The first method achieves the complexity reduction by transforming the affine LPV system into a parameter-ordered form and establishing an affine upper bound of the system Gramians, which is extended to time-varying rate-bounded parameters. The second method is based on considering the sensitivity function of the transfer function and time evolution equations. Both methods are applied to a thermal model. Simulation results together with some analysis are given. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Stochastic kriging is a popular metamodeling technique to approximate computationally expensive simulation models. However, it typically treats the simulation model as a black box in practice and often fails to capture the highly nonlinear response surfaces that arise from queueing simulations. We propose a simple, effective approach to improve the performance of stochastic kriging by incorporating stylized queueing models that contain useful information about the shape of the response surface. We provide several statistical tools to measure the usefulness of the incorporated stylized models. We show that even a relatively crude stylized model can substantially improve the prediction accuracy of stochastic kriging. © 2018, Copyright © 2018 “IISE”.},

abstract={A global optimisation strategy based on the hybrid surrogate model method and the competitive mechanism-based multi-objective particle swarm optimisation (CMOPSO) algorithm was developed to improve the accuracy of the aerodynamic performance optimisation of a high-speed train running in open air without a crosswind. Free-form deformation was used to improve the optimisation efficiency without remodelling or remeshing. The sample points and their responses were obtained via optimal Latin hypercube sampling and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The hybrid surrogate model (HSM) was constructed by using the theory of optimal weighted surrogate to combine a polynomial response surface (PRS) model with a radial basis function (RBF) model. Comprehensive error evaluation results indicated that the prediction accuracy achieved with the HSM was higher than that achieved with either the PRS model or the RBF model; thus, the HSM was selected for use in each iteration to approximate the CFD simulation model of the high-speed train in subsequent optimisation. Then, the CMOPSO algorithm was selected as the optimisation algorithm. After optimisation, a series of Pareto-optimal solutions was obtained, and the optimal and original head shapes were compared. The use of the hybrid surrogate model and the CMOPSO algorithm greatly improved the optimisation efficiency. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The paper presents computationally efficient optimization of wideband antennas using enhanced adaptive response scaling (ARS). ARS is a surrogate-assisted scheme with the faster representation (surrogate) of the original, high-fidelity EM-simulated model constructed by applying nonlinear frequency and amplitude correction to the lower-fidelity model. The latter is also a full-wave model but simulated at coarse discretization of the antenna structure at hand. In order to allow efficient execution of ARS, the optimization process is embedded in the trust-region (TR) framework with the surrogate updated upon completing each successful iteration of the TR procedure rather than after the entire surrogate model optimization cycle (as in the original ARS implementation). Here, the improved ARS is demonstrated through optimization of miniaturized wideband antennas. Two design scenarios are considered: (i)improvement of antenna matching, and (ii) reduction of antenna footprint. Comprehensive benchmarking indicates that ARS outperforms with respect to the computational cost of the optimization process conventional optimization based on trustregion gradient search. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Accurately simulating viral dynamics within a human body is often computationally intensive, thus requiring dedicated computing infrastructures. This limits the use of simulations in personalized medicine since patients may not all have access to such infrastructures or the possibility of waiting weeks for predictions. Lowering the computational burden by simplifying the models is a challenge since simulation results must remain accurate in order to safely support the decision-making activities of patients. In this work, we use machine learning to predict the results of a simulation (i.e. surrogate model) and its computational resources (i.e. performance model). This allows patients to use machine learning as a computationally light proxy to simulations and to know how long an accurate simulation would take. We demonstrate that machine learning can build such surrogate and performance models with low errors for five previously developed models of HIV, while outperforming interpolation methods commonly used for surrogate modeling. © 2020 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS)},

abstract={The major bottleneck of electromagnetic (EM)-driven antenna design is the high CPU cost of massive simulations required by parametric optimization, uncertainty quantification, or robust design procedures. Fast surrogate models may be employed to mitigate this issue to a certain extent. Unfortunately, the curse of dimensionality is a serious limiting factor, hindering the construction of conventional data-driven models valid over wide ranges of the antenna parameters and operating conditions. This paper proposes a novel surrogate modeling approach that capitalizes on two recently proposed frameworks: the nested kriging approach and two-stage Gaussian process regression (GPR). In our methodology, the first-level surrogate, of nested kriging, is applied to define the confined domain of the model in which the final surrogate is constructed using two-stage GPR. The latter permits blending information from a sparsely sampled high-fidelity EM simulation model and a densely sampled low-fidelity (or coarse-mesh) model. This combination enables significant computational savings in terms of training data acquisition while retaining excellent predictive power of the surrogate. At the same time, the proposed framework inherits all the benefits of nested kriging, including ease of uniform sampling of the confined domain, as well as straightforward generation of a good initial design for surrogate model optimization. Comprehensive benchmarking carried out using two antenna examples demonstrates superiority of our technique over conventional surrogates (unconfined domain), and standard GPR applied to the confined domain. Application examples for antenna optimization are also provided. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract={Natural gas is a vital component of the world's energy supply. Therefore, optimizing natural gas processes is important to facilitate more efficient and less costly operations. Optimization which relies exclusively on simulation is impractical, due to the enormous computational cost of complex simulations. Alternatively, surrogate models can be constructed from and used in lieu of actual simulation models. The proposed work aims to develop a black-box surrogate-based optimization model that represents the natural gas treatment process which consist of separation, sweetening and dehydration units. A combination of simulation, experimental design, data analytics and mathematical programming was utilized. The problem size was reduced by using a regression model of the system's behavior. The regression model was based on the simulation and experimental design. This simplified model was then used in a mathematical programming model minimizing a cost function. The methodology is suitable for synthesis of large-scale complex problems with fewer degrees of freedom. Linear regression along with polynomial feature transformation machine learning methods were used to generate the surrogate model. A case study was developed to investigate the impact of increasing H2S composition in the feed gas. It was observed that the feed pressure had the highest influence among the parameters. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={The paper proposes a novel three-stage framework for rapid and reliable design optimization of complex impedance matching transformers for energy harvesting applications. Our approach involves inverse and forward surrogate modeling techniques. The inverse model is utilized to obtain a good initial transformer dimensions at the equivalent network modeling level. The forward surrogates (here, space mapping ones) permit rapid design closure at the full-wave EM simulation modeling level. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a four-section compact transformer for energy harvesting applications. The circuit dimensions are scaled within wide ranges of the load impedance magnitude and phase (from 30 to 130 ohm and -26.5 to 26.5 degrees, respectively) at low computational cost corresponding to up to three EM analyses of the transformer structure. Reliability of the framework is validated through comprehensive numerical experiments as well as application case studies. The latter are provided to indicate that appropriate transformer design is critical for performance improvement of the rectifier circuits, both in terms of operational bandwidth and matching. © 2018 European Microwave Association - EuMA.},

abstract={With improved efficiencies, auto-guided vehicle (AGV) systems have developed rapidly and matured technologically in recent years. This research presents meta-model based two-stage simulation optimization for AGV systems with charging mechanisms. The optimal settings of the AGV system for the design and operational levels are proposed. Input data are collected from a real production environment. To develop the simulation model, several designs of the AGV system are developed and validated. This study aims to determine the number of required AGVs for the design-level simulation in the context of fixed guide-path constraints. For the operation-level issues, the charging system, positioning, and dispatching and routing rules for the AGV system are determined for the second-stage simulation. A factorial experiment is conducted using simulation models with different charging systems, in which output data are used to construct the metamodels. By applying global metamodel-based optimization, the obtained responses on the AGV utilization and throughput are optimized. Subsequently, a desirability approach is applied to optimize these responses. The proposed study is expected to provide a practical model for real application, facilitate the evaluation of policies prior to making decisions, and improve the efficiency of the AGV systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Hypothetical and real case studies were combined to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of a surrogate-based cyclic feedback updating approach for groundwater contamination source identification (GCSI) at dense non-aqueous-phase liquid (DNAPL)-contaminated sites. Support vector regression (SVR), kriging, and kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) models were integrated to build a surrogate model of the multiphase flow simulation model with a high computational efficiency. A mixed homotopy-differential evolution (DE) algorithm is presented to solve the optimization model, in which the integrated surrogate model was embedded, to obtain the identification results, and a cyclic feedback updating process was developed to gradually improve the results. Finally, GCSI uncertainty analysis was conducted using the Monte Carlo method. The results showed that the integrated surrogate model accurately approximates the simulation model, with a mean relative error of only 2.56%. The combination of the homotopy algorithm and DE algorithm provided an effective improvement over the traditional heuristic algorithm, and the mean relative error of the identified source characteristics was limited to 3.28%. GCSI accuracy was significantly improved after the application of the cyclic feedback updating method by reducing the mean relative error of the final identification results to 2.14%. In addition, the probability distribution characteristics of the identification results were obtained via uncertainty analysis to provide a comprehensive and reliable reference for decision makers. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={This paper proposes a control scheme for seven level asymmetrical cascaded H-bridge multi level inverter (ACHBMLI) based on fractional order calculus. The seven level ACHBMLI consists of two H-bridges that are connected in series and are excited by different dc voltage sources. A simplified model is developed by assuming the small signal variation component is equal in both the H-bridges. A fractional order PID (FO-PID) controller is designed for the ACHBMLI using the simplified model. Simulation study shows the adequacy of FO-PID controller in giving an output voltage with minimum distortions. A conventional PID controller is also designed for ACHBMLI using the same simplified model. The performance of the ACHBMLI with FO-PID controller is compared with the performance of ACHBMLI with conventional PID controller. The simulation results prove the superiority of FO-PID controller in maintaining the output voltage of the ACHBMLI close to the reference voltage and in reducing the harmonic distortion of output voltage of the inverter.

abstract={Use of hand-held sanding machines can cause excessive vibrations, which may induce various diseases, so the vibrations should be suppressed in the design process. This work focuses on the vibration optimization of an orbital sander based on a surrogate model. Housing vibrations along three axes of this machine are tested at four different points, and the experimental results are in good agreement with the acceleration values obtained from the simulated model established in ADAMS, which demonstrates the higher accuracy of the dynamic model. In order to reduce the vibrations, an automatic optimization strategy is presented by integrating four pieces of software in ISIGHT platform. Thus, the geometrical parameters of the soft nylon posts and the counterbalance in this machine are selected as design variables, housing accelerations of six separated directions as criteria. To improve the optimization efficiency, a surrogate model is set up based on Elliptical Basis Functions by selecting sample points with the Optimal Latin Hypercube DOE technique; and the influence distribution analysis of the design variables on the housing vibrations is performed according to these DOE data, which suggests that the counterbalance parameters are the key factors to the housing vibrations. Furthermore, error analysis of this approximate model shows that it is precise enough to conduct the following optimization. Consequently, the optimization results show that housing vibrations are reduced by 48%, 37% and 36% in three different directions, respectively, with the better design variables of the orbital sander. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Well placement optimization is a decisive task for the reliable design of field development plans. The use of optimization routines coupled to reservoir simulation models as an automatic tool is a popular practice, which could improve the decision-making process on well placement problems. However, despite the various automatic techniques developed, there is still a lack of robust computer-added optimization tool, which can solve the well placement problem with high accuracy in reasonable time while handling the technical constraints properly. In this paper, a hybrid intelligent system is proposed to deal with a real well placement problem with arbitrary well trajectories, complex model grids, and linear and nonlinear constraints. In this intelligent approach, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) combined with a hybrid constraint-handling strategy is applied in conjunction with a constrained space-filling sampling design, Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model, and one proposed adaptive sampling routine. This self-adaptive framework allows to consecutively augment the quality of surrogate, enhance the accuracy of the process, and thus guide the optimization rapidly into the optimal solution. To demonstrate the efficiency of the developed method, a full-field reservoir case is considered. This case covers a real well placement project in a fractured unconventional reservoir of El Gassi, which is a mature field located in Hassi-Massoud, Algeria. The obtained results highlighted the effectiveness of the proposed approach for solving the real well placement problem with high accuracy in reasonable CPU-time. These auspicious features make it a reliable tool to be used on other real optimization projects. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Because complex systems contain multiple hybrid and interactive subsystems, it poses a huge challenge to simulation modeling. Simulation research based on multi-paradigm modeling has become an important method for the study of complex systems. Emergency evacuation system is a typical complex system, which has complex interaction among evacuation individual, emergency environment and emergency subsystem. In order to solve the problem of reusability, interoperability and configurability of evacuation system simulation models and improve the efficiency of model utilization, this paper proposes a multi-paradigm modeling framework for emergency evacuation research. A meta-model method based on three paradigms of agent, system dynamics and discrete events is proposed for constructing evacuation individuals, emergency environments and emergency events respectively. It gives a new idea for constructing evacuation simulation system models. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The article addresses an approximate solution to the multi-objective optimization problem for a black-box function of a manufacturing system. We employ the surrogate of the discrete-event simulation model of a batch production system in an analytical form. Integration of simulation, Design of Experiments methods, and Weighted Sum and Weighted Product multi-objective methods are used in an arrangement of a priori defined preferences to find a solution near the Pareto optimal solution in a criterion space. We compare the results obtained through the analytical approach to the outcomes of simulation-based optimization. The observed results indicate a possibility to apply the suitable analytical model for quickly finding the acceptable approximate solution close to the Pareto optimal front. © 2020, MDPI AG.

abstract={Improving predictive understanding of Earth system variability and change requires data-model integration. Efficient data-model integration for complex models requires surrogate modeling to reduce model evaluation time. However, building a surrogate of a large-scale Earth system model (ESM) with many output variables is computationally intensive because it involves a large number of expensive ESM simulations. In this effort, we propose an efficient surrogate method capable of using a few ESM runs to build an accurate and fast-to-evaluate surrogate system of model outputs over large spatial and temporal domains. We first use singular value decomposition to reduce the output dimensions and then use Bayesian optimization techniques to generate an accurate neural network surrogate model based on limited ESM simulation samples. Our machine-learning-based surrogate methods can build and evaluate a large surrogate system of many variables quickly. Thus, whenever the quantities of interest change, such as a different objective function, a new site, and a longer simulation time, we can simply extract the information of interest from the surrogate system without rebuilding new surrogates, which significantly reduces computational efforts. We apply the proposed method to a regional ecosystem model to approximate the relationship between eight model parameters and 42&thinsp;660 carbon flux outputs. Results indicate that using only 20 model simulations, we can build an accurate surrogate system of the 42&thinsp;660 variables, wherein the consistency between the surrogate prediction and actual model simulation is 0.93 and the mean squared error is 0.02. This highly accurate and fast-to-evaluate surrogate system will greatly enhance the computational efficiency of data-model integration to improve predictions and advance our understanding of the Earth system. © Author(s) 2019.

abstract={When the dynamic model of a classical optimal control problem is explicit, we can transform this problem into a nonlinear programming problem and solve it by employing a traditional method. However, in some cases, no mathematical model of state equations is provided explicitly except for input–output data obtained from a simulation model. The hybrid model composed of functional mockup unit blocks generated in multiple platforms is a typical example. In this work, we regard these blocks as black-box models and use hierarchical neural network model to surrogate right-hand-side derivative functions of state equations. Specifically, to obtain highly accurate hierarchical neural network model, we explore a spatial adaptive partitioning criterion combining global sensitivity indices and interval length of local spaces based on the input–output data. Compared with models trained by several other partition criteria, numerical results verify that surrogate models obtained by the spatial adaptive partitioning method have higher accuracy. A mathematical example and a trajectory optimization problem of the black-box industrial robot Manutec r3 indicate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy. © 2019 ISA},

abstract={As the main force-bearing component in the side impact of automobiles, the bending performance design of B-pillar is especially important in the study of the side impact resistance of automobiles. In the optimization design of B-pillar crashworthiness, the complexity of its structure increases the difficulty and cost to modify the parameters of test and simulation models. In order to solve the above problems, a mini-car B-pillar was selected as the research object to simplify it into a single cap beam with a reinforcing plate, and the accuracy of the simplified model was verified through quasi-static three-point bending test. Afterwards, with the design variables of single cap beam reinforcement plate, inner plate, outer plate and distance from the reinforcement plate, taking the average loading force and mass as design objectives, the response surface approximation model method was used to build an approximation model, and the Pareto front of the design objective was obtained by optimizing with NSGA-II. Finally, the average loading force of the final B-pillar increased by 7.165%, the mass decreased by 4.985%, and the bending performance was significantly improved, while meets the weight reduction requirement. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of Wuhan University of Technology.

abstract={The paper proposes a novel three-stage framework for rapid and reliable design optimization of complex impedance matching transformers for energy harvesting applications. Our approach involves inverse and forward surrogate modeling techniques. The inverse model is utilized to obtain a good initial transformer dimensions at the equivalent network modeling level. The forward surrogates (here, space mapping ones) permit rapid design closure at the full-wave EM simulation modeling level. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a four-section compact transformer for energy harvesting applications. The circuit dimensions are scaled within wide ranges of the load impedance magnitude and phase (from 30 to 130 ohm and -26.5 to 26.5 degrees, respectively) at low computational cost corresponding to up to three EM analyses of the transformer structure. Reliability of the framework is validated through comprehensive numerical experiments as well as application case studies. The latter are provided to indicate that appropriate transformer design is critical for performance improvement of the rectifier circuits, both in terms of operational bandwidth and matching. © 2018 European Microwave Association.},

abstract={The Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) model is frequently-used in simulating ion transport through ion channel systems. Due to the nonlinearity and coupling of PNP model, choosing appropriate initial values is crucial to obtaining a convergent result or accelerating the convergence rate of finite element solution, especially for large channel systems. Continuation is an effective and commonly adopted strategy to provide good initial guesses for the solution procedure. However, this method needs multiple times to solve the whole system at different conditions. We utilize a reduced model describing a near-or partial-equilibrium state as an approximation of the original PNP system (describing a non-equilibrium process in general). Based on the reduced model, we design three initialization methods for the solution of PNP equations under general conditions. These methods provide the initial guess of the PNP system by solving a specifically designed Poisson-Boltzmann-like model, Smoluchowski-Poisson-Boltzmann-like model, and linear approximation model. Simulations of potassium channels 1BL8 and 2JK4 demonstrate that these methods can effectively reduce the number of Gummel iteration steps and the total CPU time in the solution of the PNP equations, and especially do not need the continuation approach anymore. The reason is that these initial guesses can approximate the PNP solution well in the channel region. Besides, our numerical experiments demonstrate that as one of the initialization methods, the linear approximation method can even produce very close results such as current-voltage curves to that from the PNP model when the membrane potential is not high. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is a powerful tool for quantifying the effects of model parameters on the performance outputs of engineering systems, such as wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Due to the ever-growing sophistication of such systems and their models, significantly longer processing times are required to perform a system-wide simulation, which makes the use of traditional Monte Carlo (MC) based approaches for calculation of GSA measures, such as Sobol indices, impractical. In this work, we present a systematic framework to construct and validate highly accurate meta-models to perform an efficient GSA of complex WWTP models such as the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 (BSM2). The robustness and the efficacy of three meta-modeling approaches, namely polynomial chaos expansion (PCE), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and artificial neural networks (ANN), are tested on four engineering scenarios. The results reveal significant computational gains of the proposed framework over the MC-based approach without compromising accuracy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A key element of the fuel channel life cycle management in CANDU® reactors is to prevent contact between the pressure tube (PT) and the calandria tube (CT) and to avoid the development of hydride blisters that lead to delayed hydride cracking of the PT. The PT-CT contact is the result of in-reactor deformation due to irradiation induced creep of the fuel channel assembly, which in turn is affected by uncertainties associated with various parameters like material properties, dimensional changes in the channel and boundary conditions (e.g., end slopes) of the channel. To account for these uncertainties, probabilistic assessment methods are developed to evaluate the risk of PT-CT contact and demonstrate compliance with provisions of the CSA Standard N285.8. Currently, a simulation is based on probabilistic assessments in which input parameters to a finite element model (FEM) of creep deformation are randomly sampled from their respective distributions. A simulation model involves numerous repetitive solutions of the FEM model to determine the probability distribution of PT-CT gap and the time to contact. Since the creep deformation analysis using FEM is computationally involved, this brute force Monte Carlo simulation method is not an efficient way to carry out the probabilistic assessment of the reactor core. This paper proposes a new line of thinking for probabilistic assessments of PT-CT contact in fuel channels, which is based on replacing a full FEM model by a surrogate model of a much simpler analytical form. The surrogate model not only simplifies the creep deformation analysis, but also provides a more logical basis for probabilistic assessments. This paper presents an insightful analysis of creep deformation and shows that a simple surrogate model can be developed to predict the PT-CT gap as a linear function of two primary random variables, namely, a creep factor and end slopes. This simplified representation has a far reaching effect on the probabilistic assessment of fuel channels. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Time and value throughputs reflect the actual workload and gross profit of enterprises over a period of time, respectively. Both of them are of great importance to the operation of data-aware workflow processes, since they can help managers to balance production capacity at each stage as well as determine how much capital should be recycled over a period of time. However, the existing methods have not investigated both time and value throughputs of data-aware workflow processes. In this paper, we propose a new approach to modeling and simulation of time and value throughputs of data-aware workflow processes. First of all, we construct an abstract model with time and value elements. Second, the abstract model is transformed into a simulation model in CPN Tools. Finally, we obtain and analyze the time and value throughputs automatically via the simulation logs. Compared with the existing methods, this is the first attempt to propose both time and value throughputs of data-aware workflow processes, and the whole procedure of modeling and simulation of them. Furthermore, the procedure of obtaining time and value throughputs through analyzing the logs is proposed, and a prototype system is designed and developed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Self-piercing rivets (SPR) are efficient and economical joining methods used in the manufacturing of lightweight automotive bodies. The finite element method (FEM) is a potentially effective way to assess the joining process of SPRs. However, uncertain parameters could lead to significant mismatches between the FEM predictions and physical tests. Thus, a sensitivity study on critical model parameters is important to guide the high-fidelity modeling of the SPR insertion process. In this paper, an axisymmetric FEM model is constructed to simulate the insertion process of the SPR using LS-DYNA/explicit. Then, several surrogate models are evaluated and trained using machine learning methods to represent the relations between selected inputs (e.g., material properties, interfacial frictions, and clamping force) and outputs (cross-section dimensions). It is found that it is feasible to train surrogate models with high accuracy to replace the time-consuming and computationally expensive CAE simulations with a limited sampling volume. Based on trained surrogate models, an extensive sensitivity study is conducted to thoroughly understand the effect of a set of model parameters. This work provides a solid foundation for data-modelling and CAE model calibration for the SPR insertion process. © 2020 SAE International; Ford Motor Company.},

abstract={Electromagnetic waveforms are an essential component of radar and electronic warfare digital computer simulations. Sampled representations of radar waveforms are widely used in high-fidelity applications for their physical realism and suitability for algorithmic processing. However, this fidelity comes at a price because operations on sampled representations are often a computationally costly simulation bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a generic framework for constructing a reduced, feature-based model component derived from a given high-fidelity component, and demonstrate the approach on a simplified radar waveform model. The reduced model is related to the original through an approximate morphism. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning are key components of the framework. © 2020 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS)},

abstract={We propose the first reduced model simulation framework for deformable solid dynamics using autoencoder neural networks. We provide a data-driven approach to generating nonlinear reduced spaces for deformation dynamics. In contrast to previous methods using machine learning which accelerate simulation by approximating the time-stepping function, we solve the true equations of motion in the latent-space using a variational formulation of implicit integration. Our approach produces drastically smaller reduced spaces than conventional linear model reduction, improving performance and robustness. Furthermore, our method works well with existing force-approximation cubature methods. © 2019 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum © 2019 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

abstract={Plenty of research has been published on algorithms for the coordinated operation of UAVs. However, little is known about these algorithms that go beyond the simulation domain. In the paper, we present a self-organized UAV flocking algorithm together with its practical validation with three real UAVs. We show how non-ideal aspects of real UAVs, as inaccurate sensor data, clocked sensor output instead of continuous data, as well as imperfect and delayed communication, can be handled. We provide a framework that allows us to develop these systems based on validated simulation models and show how the same framework can be directly implemented on real UAVs, closing the gap between abstract modeling and physical implementation on UAVs. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={In numerical modeling of geological carbon sequestration (GCS), uncertainty quantification (UQ) is usually needed to evaluate the impact of uncertain model parameters on model predictions caused by limited measurements and incomplete knowledge of the parameters. However, UQ for GCS is computationally expensive due to the large ensemble of complex and lengthy model simulations. In this study, we propose an adaptive Kriging method to build a fast-to-evaluate surrogate of the GCS model to alleviate the heavy computational burden. The surrogate model is efficiently generated using a Taylor expansion-based adaptive experimental design algorithm that combines a distance-based exploration criterion and an exploitation criterion to adaptively search for informative training samples. In addition, we analyze the uncertainty brought by substituting the surrogate for the actual simulation model and explore its influence on UQ results. Our method is demonstrated in a synthetic GCS model and its performance is evaluated in comparison with the conventional Monte Carlo sampling. Results indicate that our method can greatly improve the computational efficiency in UQ and provide an effective and reliable UQ solution with the consideration of surrogate uncertainty. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={With a growing share of inverter-interfaced generation in modern power systems, synchronous inertia is declining. This leads to faster frequency drop after large generation trip events. During low inertia conditions, frequency containment reserves might not be sufficient to arrest frequency before it reaches the threshold for underfrequency load shedding. It is therefore becoming increasingly important for system operators to be able to assess frequency response in near real time. In contrast to detailed models, simplified models offer short simulation times and their parameters can be accurately identified and adapted to changing system conditions in near real time. In this paper, the parameters of governor response models are identified by minimizing the error residuals between the simulation models’ and the actual system’s measured active power response. This is accomplished by using historic event data from two system operators: the Electric Reliability Council Of Texas (ERCOT) and the Swedish Svenska kraftnät (Svk). Then, the respective frequency response models are simulated to assess frequency response. The results show that, despite their simplicity, the models provide a very good fit compared to the actual response. The models of ERCOT and Svk are examined; however, a similar approach can be employed to represent the frequency response of other power systems. © 2020, CIGRE. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The semiconductor sector is undergoing one of the fastest market growths. Demand is increasing and market forecasts are optimistic. New markets are emerging and product portfolios are broadening significantly. Dynamic supply chains are developing with increasing number of customers, products, suppliers and manufacturing partnerships. Up to now due to modeling complexity and computation time constraints, disjoint systems are used for local supply chain control and optimization. For efficient control, these complex semiconductor supply chains require a global approach for simulation and optimization. This is the motivation for this conceptual paper. In the conceptual part this paper introduces and discusses novel model aggregation approaches and model validity improvements with novel hierarchical modeling concepts. In the modeling part this paper incorporates that into an aggregated simulation model approach as well as a novel hierarchical interface concept for coupling of disaggregated analytical and simulation models to systematically improve overall model validity at Bosch. © 2018 IEEE},

abstract={This paper investigates the applicability of model emulation to speed up simulation time of CPU intensive environmental models. Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) emulators are constructed for three case studies of increasing complexity. The level of emulator training and the order of polynomial necessary to sufficiently build accurate emulators for each model are investigated. Although the PCE emulators shown here do not approximate well the outputs of parameter rich models (80 + parameters), results demonstrate that the emulators mimic closely outputs of relatively simple, low dimensional, simulation models (15 parameters or less). Furthermore, the PCE emulators are tested with applications such as Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). Results illustrate the advantages and drawbacks of using classical PCE emulators for treating computational limitation of complex environmental models. © 2018},

abstract={Modeling and Simulation (M&S) is an ever growing field that utilizes increasingly complex and expensive simulations often requiring lots of time to run, can be difficult to maintain and analyze, but whose use continues to provide useful insight into leadership decisions. In a time critical decision situation, running such models may not be a practical approach to provide leadership the insights they need when they need those insights. Bayesian Networks (BN) are a useful analytical tool that offer understandable probabilistic relationships between variables, efficient computation, and quick analytical results. A BN indexed by time is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). A drawback to their use as a meta-model is the number of runs needed to train either the BN or DBN. This research introduces and demonstrates the use of bootstrapping techniques to reduce the number of actual simulation runs necessary to sufficiently train DBNs used as simulation meta-models. DBNs trained with independent simulation runs are compared to DBNs trained with bootstrapped-based samples developed on various sized subsets of actual simulation runs, the DBNs are compared statistically, and empirical examples are used to demonstrate the methodology. A method extending the DBN meta-model to multiple dimensions is presented and demonstrated. A case study using an actual combat simulation model completes the presentation. © 2017},

abstract={Given a costly to compute function m: Rd→ R, which is part of a simulation model, and an Rd-valued random variable with known distribution, the problem of estimating a quantile qm ( X ) , α is investigated. The presented approach has a nonparametric nature. Monte Carlo quantile estimates are obtained by estimating m through some estimate (surrogate) mn and then by using an initial quantile estimate together with importance sampling to construct an importance sampling surrogate quantile estimate. A general error bound on the error of this quantile estimate is derived, which depends on the local error of the function estimate mn, and the convergence rates of the corresponding importance sampling surrogate quantile estimates are analyzed. The finite sample size behavior of the estimates is investigated by applying the estimates to simulated data. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The paper aims to address the issue of comparing agent-based models (ABMs) with more traditional VAR and DSGE models by developing a multivariate extension of the Markov Information Criterion (MIC) of Barde (2017). The univariate MIC measures the informational distance between a simulation model and some empirical data by mapping the simulated data to a Markov transition matrix, and is proven to provide an unbiased measurement for all models reducible to a Markov process. As a result, the MIC can accurately measure distance using only simulated data, for a wide class of data generating processes. The paper first presents the multivariate extension of the MIC and its validation on VAR and DGSE models before carrying the first direct comparison between a macroeconomic ABM and a DGSE model, namely the benchmark ABM of Caiani et al. (2016) and Smets and Wouters (2007). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A significant part of the housing stock in southern Europe is obsolete and in need of extensive retrofitting to improve its energy performance and thermal comfort. However, before adequate retrofit measures can be proposed for this housing stock, the characterization of current building performance is fundamental. Although the simulation tools frequently used and widely accepted by the scientific community ensure accurate results, these require high computational times. The main aim of this paper is the development of a surrogate model to speed up the thermal comfort prediction for any member of a building category, ensuring high reliability by testing the entire simulation process with real data measured in-situ. To this end, an artificial neural network (ANN) is generated under MATLAB® environment using the data obtained from EnergyPlus simulations for linear-type social housing multi-family buildings in southern Spain, which were constructed in the post-war period. The developed ANN provides a regression coefficient between simulation targets and ANN outputs of 0.96, with a relative error between monitored and simulated data below 9%. A further result is that the building category characterization shows a general lack of suitable indoor thermal comfort conditions, thereby showing the great need for effective retrofit strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Redesigning a microwave circuit for various operating conditions is a practically important yet challenging problem. The purpose of this article is development and presentation of a technique for fast geometry scaling of miniaturized microwave couplers with respect to operating frequency. Our approach exploits an inverse surrogate model constructed using several reference designs that are optimized for a set of operating frequencies within a range of interest. For the sake of computational efficiency, the reference designs are obtained for an equivalent network model of the coupler. The surrogate directly predicts the optimum values of geometry parameters of the structure at hand corresponding to a requested operating frequency. By introducing appropriate correction, the model allows for coupler scaling at the EM simulation model level. Because the surrogate does not carry information about the power split ratio of the coupler, an additional analytical corrective procedure is developed to ensure an equal power split of scaled structure. The computational cost of the scaling procedure corresponds to only two EM analyses of the circuit at hand (including both correction steps). The operation and performance of our technique is demonstrated using a compact microstrip rat-race coupler scaled for the operating frequency range of 0.5-2.5 GHz. Experimental validation is also provided. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={We introduce an algorithm for the optimization of problems whose objective functions are evaluated by computationally expensive black-box simulations and for which an analytic description of the objective and its derivatives are not available. We consider the case where two levels of simulation model fidelity are available, namely a high fidelity model that is computationally very expensive to evaluate, and a low fidelity model that is less accurate and computationally cheaper but still time consuming. The computational effort is alleviated by using computationally cheap surrogate models that approximate the simulations at both fidelity levels. The local correlation between both fidelity surrogate models determines when the low fidelity model can be trusted for making sampling decisions for the high fidelity model. In the numerical experiments we investigate how well our algorithm responds to problems whose objective function fidelity levels are well correlated and badly correlated. We study how different initial design strategies and parameter settings impact the performance of the algorithm. The results show that our algorithm actively learns from the local correlation computations how well suited the low fidelity model is for making sampling decisions and it ignores the low fidelity model if the correlation is too low. © 2020 University of Toronto Press Inc..

abstract={Seawater intrusion monitoring is quite different from the conventional monitoring of groundwater pollution. In this study, a new optimization method for the seawater intrusion monitoring scheme in the transitional zone was proposed. The objective of optimization was to maximize effective information monitored. The structural similarity index method (SSIM) of the image quality assessment was innovatively used to establish a mathematical expression for the effective monitored information, and an optimization model was constructed based on this. Taken the Longkou city of China as the study area, a numerical simulation model of variable density groundwater was constructed. The Monte Carlo method was used to consider the influence of the sensitivity parameters uncertainty on the monitoring scheme design. To avoid repeatedly calling of simulation models in the process of Monte Carlo experiments, a surrogate model was constructed by using the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM). Finally, the optimization model was solved by the genetic algorithm to obtain the optimal monitoring scheme. The results showed that the input-output relationship of the numerical simulation model for variable-density groundwater can be well approximated by the KELM surrogate model. The monitoring scheme optimized by the above method can well reflect the real state of seawater intrusion. This study expands the method on the scheme designs for seawater intrusion monitoring. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Transit interchange discounts encourage people to travel by public transport, increasing the revenue of the operators. This research develops a transit assignment model, which takes account of the actual travel time, congestion and fare of the public transport, using an agent-based simulation model MATSim. Then, a simulation-based optimization problem is formulated to optimize the interchange discount to maximize profit. For computational efficiency, a metamodeling technique is further proposed and the metamodel can serve as a surrogate of the expensive simulation process. Transfer hubs are set up in a Hong Kong Island scenario and the interchange discount for bus-bus interchanges is optimized. The optimization result shows that the optimal interchange discount optimized by the proposed metamodel-based method increases the bus operators' profit by 12%. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in metal additive manufacturing (AM) has attracted tremendous interest in order to dramatically improve product reliability. Model-based UQ, which relies on the validity of a computational model, has been widely explored as a potential substitute for the time-consuming and expensive UQ solely based on experiments. However, its adoption in the practical AM process requires overcoming two main challenges: (1) the inaccurate knowledge of uncertainty sources and (2) the intrinsic uncertainty associated with the computational model. Here, we propose a data-driven framework to tackle these two challenges by combining high throughput physical/surrogate model simulations and the AM-Bench experimental data from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). We first construct a surrogate model, based on high throughput physical simulations, for predicting the three-dimensional (3D) melt pool geometry and its uncertainty with respect to AM parameters and uncertainty sources. We then employ a sequential Bayesian calibration method to perform experimental parameter calibration and model correction to significantly improve the validity of the 3D melt pool surrogate model. The application of the calibrated melt pool model to UQ of the porosity level, an important quality factor, of AM parts, demonstrates its potential use in AM quality control. The proposed UQ framework can be generally applicable to different AM processes, representing a significant advance toward physics-based quality control of AM products. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={The prediction of streamflow helps to identify the disasters and sources of water resources. Different ways to predict the streamflow, among the conceptual models have been gained more popularity due to explanation of processes and visualization in water resources systems. Any model may not obtain the acceptable performance at initial setup and it has to go through calibration or optimization (either manual or auto-calibration). Moreover, the calibration procedure is more concern of computational time for complex conceptual models like Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Where, meta models are the alternative approach to restrict the computationally intensive optimization problems because it is cheaper models to enhance the performance and shows the relationship between input-output response. Our results showed that 1) meta models mimics the original simulation models with effective and efficient outputs and 2) it verified and satisfied the performance of SWAT model with less computational time. This study helps to planning and designing of hydrological models with effective computational time. © 2016 Author.},

abstract={We consider Bayesian inference when only a limited number of noisy log-likelihood evaluations can be obtained. This occurs for example when complex simulator-based statistical models are fitted to data, and synthetic likelihood (SL) method is used to form the noisy log-likelihood estimates using computationally costly forward simulations. We frame the inference task as a sequential Bayesian experimental design problem, where the log-likelihood function is modelled with a hierarchical Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model, which is used to efficiently select additional log-likelihood evaluation locations. Motivated by recent progress in the related problem of batch Bayesian optimisation, we develop various batch-sequential design strategies which allow to run some of the potentially costly simulations in parallel. We analyse the properties of the resulting method theoretically and empirically. Experiments with several toy problems and simulation models suggest that our method is robust, highly parallelisable, and sample-efficient. © 2021 International Society for Bayesian Analysis},

abstract={An approach for the application of differential game theory to control a realistic flight simulator model is presented. In the context of aircraft control safe operation must be ensured particularly under external disturbances (e.g. wind). The application of viability theory enables a determination of envelopes (viability kernels) in which safe operation is guaranteed. Here, a state-feedback control law can be derived based on a viability kernel which keeps the dynamic system within a set of safe states. So far, our solver implementation on a supercomputer allows us to compute viability kernels for general nonlinear dynamic systems in up to seven state dimensions. Unfortunately, the mathematical model of the flight simulator consists of about one hundred differential equations. Therefore, the following procedure is used to enable the application of the viability kernel based control. First, a reduced model of the flight simulator model is derived for the calculation of the viability kernel in up to seven state dimensions. Then, the optimal controls are determined through the evaluation of the precomputed viability kernel using the reduced model. In order to apply the optimal controls to the flight simulator model a Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) control architecture is used. This NDI controller contains two cascaded control loops with modified reference models of relative degree one. Numerical experiments in a cruise flight condition using different wind disturbances suggest that the proposed control procedure keeps the considered states of the flight simulator model within the viability kernel. © 20202020 for this paper by its authors.

abstract={Fast and reliable statistical analysis of compact microwave couplers is addressed. The proposed technique exploits variable-fidelity electromagnetic (EM) simulation models as well as a response feature approach. By establishing a local feature-based surrogate of the structure at hand, as well as a mapping between characteristic points of EM models of various fidelities, yield estimation can be carried out at extremely low cost of a few high-fidelity EM analyses. The methodology has been demonstrated using a CMRC-based miniaturized equal power split rat-race coupler operating at 1 GHz. Reliability of the approach is verified by comparing with direct Monte Carlo analysis and single-fidelity feature-based yield estimation. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a dynamic model approximation strategy that allows to significantly increase computational efficiency of the simulation while maintaining proper validity. This can be used to effectively overcome the scalability constraints in state-of-the-art simulation frameworks for testing and validating large-scale systems. The method that we present leverages information theory metrics to measure the possible contribution of sub-areas in the simulation to the global behavior. This allows us to opportunistically approximate low-contributing areas and as a result decrease the computational cost of the simulation. We present a basic traffic-simulation use-case, implemented in the Acsim simulator to validate the proposed method and are able to achieve a 33% reduction of the computational cost. Furthermore, we analyze our proposed method from a more theoretical perspective. ©2019 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

abstract={In this article, we consider the problem of estimating quantiles related to the outcome of experiments with a technical system given the distribution of the input together with an (imperfect) simulation model of the technical system and (few) data points from the technical system. The distribution of the outcome of the technical system is estimated in a regression model, where the distribution of the residuals is estimated on the basis of a conditional density estimate. It is shown how Monte Carlo can be used to estimate quantiles of the outcome of the technical system on the basis of the above estimates, and the rate of convergence of the quantile estimate is analyzed. Under suitable assumptions, it is shown that this rate of convergence is faster than the rate of convergence of standard estimates which ignore either the (imperfect) simulation model or the data from the technical system; hence, it is crucial to combine both kinds of information. The results are illustrated by applying the estimates to simulated and real data. © 2018, The Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo.},

abstract={In the automotive industry, high efforts are made to design high-efficiency, low-cost, requirement-optimized electric drives. Traditionally, time-consuming and expensive 3D finite element analyses are used to assess the effects of different design parameters from various engineering disciplines such as the electromagnetics, heat transfer, and mechanics. Often, to decrease the calculation efforts, scalable, physics-based reduced order models are used. For setting up and interpreting such reduced order models, simulation experts employ implicit knowledge by applying heuristic correction factors. This paper proposes a novel method to formalizing such implicit simulation knowledge using Gaussian Processes. Furthermore, the successful application of the method to a case study of electric motors is reported by validating the aforementioned correction factors for different motor designs. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Defence Science and Technology Group (DST) is investigating the characteristics of Land Combat Vehicles (LCVs) with a view to improving purchasing decisions between different LCV options. Using a combination of closed-loop combat simulation (i.e., one run without any human interventions) and subject matter experts (SMEs), these studies seek to understand the close combat capability factors for a future LCV. These factors are being investigated for different kinds of physical environment and different levels of enemy lethality, with each LCV's lethality, survivability, signature (the ease with which the enemy identifies friendly forces) and knowledge acquisition (friendly forces identifying enemies) being measured, yielding a multi-dimensional view of the different LCVs and their performance. Our study describes a new approach, developing a Bayesian network (BN) meta-model (i.e., a model based upon the combat simulation model; see Fig 1) that combines those multiple dimensions in a single multicriterial decision model. Figure 1. A Bayesian network meta-model (from the PC algorithm). Both deterministic and stochastic methods have been developed for multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). Limitations to prior approaches include treating utilities as independent of each other and also very limited ability to deal with uncertainty about preferences. Bayesian networks offer advantages in these regards, so here we develop an alternative approach using a BN meta-model for decision making and evaluating the operational impact of different LCV choices. BNs support both the prediction of operational results and their causal explanation. These BNs were developed both from expert elicitation and causal discovery (data mining) from combat simulation data, and enable causal visualization, sensitivity analysis and optimization. We evaluate the performance of some of these BNs against alternatives, using common accuracy-based evaluation metrics. Please note that the example and data presented in this paper are not representative of the real LCV options and testing scenario, they are used for methodology illustration only.

abstract={Laser Powder-Bed Fusion (L-PBF) metal-based additive manufacturing (AM) is complex and not fully understood. Successful processing for one material, might not necessarily apply to a different material. This paper describes a workflow process that aims at creating a material data sheet standard that describes regimes where the process can be expected to be robust. The procedure consists of building a Gaussian process-based surrogate model of the L-PBF process that predicts melt pool depth in single-track experiments given a laser power, scan speed, and laser beam size combination. The predictions are then mapped onto a power versus scan speed diagram delimiting the conduction from the keyhole melting controlled regimes. This statistical framework is shown to be robust even for cases where experimental training data might be suboptimal in quality, if appropriate physics-based filters are applied. Additionally, it is demonstrated that a high-fidelity simulation model of L-PBF can equally be successfully used for building a surrogate model, which is beneficial since simulations are getting more efficient and are more practical to study the response of different materials, than to re-tool an AM machine for new material powder. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd.},

abstract={For stationary power sources such as utility boilers, it is useful to dispose of parametric models able to describe their behavior in a wide range of operating conditions, to predict some Quantities of Interest (QOIs) that need to be consistent with experimental observations. The development of predictive simulation tools for large scale systems cannot rely on full-order models, as the latter would lead to prohibitive costs when coupled to sampling techniques in the model parameter space. An alternative approach consists of using a Surrogate Model (SM). As the number of QOIs is often high and many SMs need to be trained, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to encode the set of QOIs in a much smaller set of scalars, called PCA scores. A SM is then built for each PCA score rather than for each QOI. The advantage of reducing the number of variables is twofold: computational costs are reduced (less SMs need to be trained) and information is preserved (correlation among the original variables). The strategy is applied to a CFD model simulating the Alstom 15 MWth oxy-pilot Boiler Simulation Facility (BSF). In practice, experiments cannot provide full coverage of the pulverized-coal utility boiler due to both practicality and costs. Values of the model's parameters which guarantee consistency with the experimental data of this test facility for 121 QOIs are found, by training a SM based on the combination of Kriging and PCA, using only 5 latent variables. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={In order to analyze and optimize energy efficiency of complex industrial facilities, methods for hybrid discrete/continuous modeling and simulation are necessary that allow to incorporate thermal-physical dynamic behavior as well as discrete aspects like entity flow into an integrated simulation model while at the same time remaining manageable for large-scale applications. One promising approach follows component-based hierarchical modeling based on a formal system specification, called hyPDEVS. However, this approach faces challenges for widespread adoption in industry due to the generic nature of the formalism and related difficulties in applying it to real-world scenarios. In an attempt to support the development of hybrid simulation models based on hyPDEVS, we present a domain-specific model abstraction for industrial facilities that is intended to allow developing application models in a platform-independent manner. Thereby, we follow a model-driven engineering paradigm that promotes the separation of model specification from the concrete implementation, i.e. source code. Compared to typical co-simulation solutions, this approach provides better semantic integration of discrete and continuous modeling aspects, thereby promoting modularity and reuse of model components. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a novel framework for generating reduced-order models that combines agglomeration of cells from existing high-fidelity reservoir models and flow-based upscaling. The framework employs a hierarchical grid-coarsening strategy that enables accurate preservation of geological structures from the underlying model. One can also use flow information to distinguish regions of high or low flow, and use this division, or other geological or user-defined quantities, to select and adapt the model resolution differently throughout the reservoir. Altogether, the framework provides a wide variety of coarsening strategies that allow the user to adapt the reduced model to important geology and explore and identify the features that most impact flow patterns and well communication. By preserving these features, while aggressively coarsening others, the user can develop reduced models that closely match an underlying high-fidelity model. Various types of simple flow diagnostics based on time-of-flight and volumetric well communication are used to predict the accuracy of the resulting reduced models. In this paper, we systematically apply this framework to the Great White Field, but also present results from other real or synthetic models, to demonstrate the asymptotic scaling of accuracy metrics with coarsening levels. Our aim is to identify and illustrate best practices when designing and improving coarsening strategies that can guide future applications of the framework to other reservoir models. We also discuss practical limitations when applying the framework to new simulation models where flow regimes or geologic features may differ. Copyright 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

abstract={In this letter, an improved algorithm for electromagnetic (EM)-driven size reduction of wideband antennas is proposed. Our methodology utilizes variable-fidelity EM simulation models, auxiliary polynomial regression surrogates, as well as multipoint response correction. The constraint handling is implicit, using penalty functions. The core optimization algorithm is a trust-region gradient search with a repair step added in order to facilitate exploration of the feasible region boundary. The latter results in considerable reduction of the computational cost of the optimization process. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using two wideband antennas and compared to both direct optimization of the high-fidelity model and the surrogate-assisted framework without the aforementioned repair step. The results indicate superiority of the presented approach. Experimental validation of the fabricated prototypes of the optimized antennas is also provided. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper explores the use of discrete event simulation (DES) for decision making in real time based on the potential for data streamed from production line sensors. Technological innovations for data collection and an increasingly competitive global market have led to an increase in the application of discrete event simulation by manufacturing companies in recent years. Scenario analysis and optimisation methods are often applied to these simulation models to improve objectives such as cost, profit and throughput. The literature review has identified key research gaps as the lack of example cases where multi-objective optimisation methods have been applied to simulation models and the need for a framework to visualise the relationship between inputs and outputs of simulation models. A framework is presented to enable the optimisation DES simulation models and optimise multiple objectives simultaneously using design of experiments and meta-models to create a Pareto front of solutions. The results show that the resource allocation meta-model provides acceptable prediction accuracy whilst the lead time meta-model was not able to provide accurate prediction. Regression trees have been proposed to assist stakeholders with understanding the relationships between input and output variables. The framework uses regression and classification trees with overlaid values for multiple objectives and random forests to improve prediction accuracy for new points. A real-life test case involving a turbine assembly process is presented to illustrate the use and validity of the framework. The generated regression tree expressed a general trend by demonstrating relationships between input variables and two conflicting objectives. Random forests were implemented for creating higher accuracy predictions and they produced a mean square error of ~ 0.066 on the training data and ~ 0.081 on test data. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Despite advances in computer capacity, the enormous computational cost of running complex engineering simulations makes it impractical to rely exclusively on simulation for the purpose of structural health monitoring. To cut down the cost, surrogate models, also known as metamodels, are constructed and then used in place of the actual simulation models. In this study, structural damage detection is performed using two approaches. In both cases ten popular metamodeling techniques including Back-Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN), Least Square Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs), Adaptive Neural-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Radial Basis Function Neural network (RBFN), Large Margin Nearest Neighbors (LMNN), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Gaussian Process (GP), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forests and Kriging are used and the comparative results are presented. In the first approach, by considering dynamic behavior of a structure as input variables, ten metamodels are constructed, trained and tested to detect the location and severity of damage in civil structures. The variation of running time, mean square error (MSE), number of training and testing data, and other indices for measuring the accuracy in the prediction are defined and calculated in order to inspect advantages as well as the shortcomings of each algorithm. The results indicate that Kriging and LS-SVM models have better performance in predicting the location/severity of damage compared with other methods. In the second approach, after locating precisely the eventual damage of a structure using modal strain energy based index (MSEBI), to efficiently reduce the computational cost of model updating during the optimization process of damage severity detection, the MSEBI of structural elements is evaluated using a properly trained surrogate model. The results indicate that after determining the damage location, the proposed solution method for damage severity detection leads to significant reduction of computational time compared to finite element method. Furthermore, engaging colliding bodies optimization algorithm (CBO) by efficient surrogate model of finite element (FE) model, maintains the acceptable accuracy of damage severity detection. © 2018},

abstract={Heterogeneous uncertainties due to model imperfection, lack of training data, and input variations coexist in simulation-based design optimization. In this work, a Bayesian-enhanced meta-model is developed to handle heterogeneous uncertainties concurrently in reliability-based design optimization. To account for model form uncertainty, a Bayesian model inference approach is first employed to calibrate unknown parameters of simulation models. Then a hybrid GP model is constructed based on a set of simulation data and experimental observations to predict the response of the actual physical system. By using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), the resultant hybrid GP model predictions are utilized to form a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for propagating heterogeneous uncertainties in system reliability analysis. An aggregative reliability index (ARI) is then defined based on GMM to approximate the probability of failure under heterogeneous uncertainties. The proposed approach is further integrated with the RBDO framework to search for optimal system designs. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through three case studies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Single-leg dynamic simulation model of a novel lander was established, and the collision between lander and landing surface was simulated with a nonlinear spring-damper model. In order to improve the simulation accuracy of the model, its stiffness coefficient, damping coefficient and nonlinear exponent were taken as collision parameters and updated based on impact test results of the physical prototype of a lander with a single set of landing buffer. For improving the calculating efficiency, Kriging surrogate model was established to correctly describe the error between simulation results and test results. Then collision parameters were updated using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II and taking minimizing the error calculated with Kriging model as an objective. The modified parameters were substituted into the simulation model to do a new simulation. Comparing calculation results of the simulation model before and after parametric updating, it was shown that compared with the impact test results, the lander's main body falling distance error is reduced from 19.2% before parametric updating to 5.9% after that, the lander's jury strut maximum buffering stroke error is reduced from 24.7% before parametric updating to 8.4% after that. © 2018, Editorial Office of Journal of Vibration and Shock.

abstract={The aim of this work is to present the development of a Surrogate Reservoir Model capable of accurately predicting cumulative oil production of a heavy oil field in Mexico considering variables with uncertainty. Five numerical models of wells were considered for the numerical model of the field. Four input uncertain variables (the dead oil viscosity with temperature, the reservoir pressure, the reservoir permeability and oil sand thickness hydraulically connected to the well) were selected as the ones with more impact on the initial hot oil production rate according to an analytical production prediction model. The central composite experimental design technique was selected to capture the maximum amount of information from the model response with a minimum number of reservoir models simulations. Twenty five runs were built to be run with the STARS simulator for each well type on the reservoir model. The results show that Surrogate Reservoir Models are an ideal tool to perform real-time probabilistic production forecasting of the reservoir. © 2018 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS)},

abstract={• There is a current trend for development of high-power electronics for power systems. To improve the efficiency of large-scale system simulations, order reduction of power electronic interfaced generator models has become an urgent problem to be addressed for the integration of new energy. In this paper, a battery energy storage system (BESS) is taken as the research object. A detailed grid-connected model is established and the time-scale of the eigenvalue sensitivity partition model is introduced. A multi-time scale model and reduced-order processing based on singular perturbation theory are analyzed, and the error is calculated for reduced-order models. Simulation analysis of the different reduced-order models proposed in this paper shows that these models can achieve a balance between computational efficiency and reduced-order accuracy for transient simulation of power electronic interfaced generator grid-connected systems, and can be adapted for efficient simulation of large-scale new energy grid-connected systems. © 2019},

abstract={Thai jewelry is the world's leading jewelry which has gained high reputation and recognition from customers worldwide. In the past decade, jewelry have become one of the top ten export product of Thailand with the current export value of around 58,000 million baht per year which is 3.4 percent of all Thailand export products. Due to the high competition in the world market, however, Thai jewelry manufacturers needs to continue to improve their product quality as well as process efficiency in order to gain more market share. Currently, computer-aided tools have become more powerful tool in jewelry production management. They have been used to design production process, plant and workstation layout, production planning, worker's scheduling, and other decisive decision making in both high management and shop floor levels. This research demonstrates a case study of plant simulation application for jewelry production process improvement. The objective is to reduce bottlenecks and increase productivity in wax pattern and casting processes using line balancing. Various scenarios have been proposed in order to support different level of desired output rate due to the increase of demand. The results of line balancing and simulation models reduce bottlenecks. Hence, productivity is increased. The desired throughput rates are achieved with the minimum number of workers and machine in the system. © 2019 Srisawat Supsomboon, published by Sciendo 2019.},

abstract={To study dynamic evolution law of mechanical reliability caused by wear, gear transmission system is taken as a research object. Considering the effect of clearance caused by wear on gear teeth load in double meshing area, the formula of dynamic distribution load which is undertaken by two adjacent teeth is deduced. And the distributed pressure and meshing speed, which should be taken into account while calculating gear wear, are obtained based on the Winkler surface model and principle of tooth mesh. Based on the Archard’s wear model, numerical simulation model for wear in spur gear is deduced, and the wear depth of each meshing points on teeth outline with different wear cycles are obtained. The calculation wear model is replaced with a surrogate model with Neural Network and Kriging method to overcome time-consuming defect. Random process model is integrated with the surrogate model, and dynamic reliability for nonlinear stochastic structure with unknown distribution characteristic is obtained with Neural Network-based Edgeworth series technique and four moment methods, which is compared with Kriging-based Monte Carlo simulation method. The computational efficiency and accuracy are also demonstrated. © 2018, Polish Academy of Sciences Branch Lublin. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper an improved approach to consider the contribution of wind turbines based on doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) for short-circuit current calculation according to IEC 60909 for a three-phase short-circuit is presented. The calculation with the equivalent voltage source at the fault location requires a simplified modelling of short-circuit contributions through impedances or current sources, whereas specific control algorithms cannot be considered. Additionally these impedances or current sources must be calculated with basic and publicly available machine parameters. The improved approach is based on equivalent circuit elements, derived from eigenvalue analyses meets the aforementioned requirements and is compared to a detailed numerical simulation model, which shows the influence of the dynamic control structure. The improved approach delivers a good estimation for the calculation of the maximum initial short-circuit current in each case. Finally, a suggestion for the consideration of DFIG, based on the improved approach is made. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper provides the description of the first step of development of an integrated platform for agro-ecosystem simulation. Specifically, this study intends to provide a framework for an explicit representation of social, economic, biophysical and political dimensions of agricultural at different scales of analysis using the component-based simulation approach. First, a meta-model for model integration has been proposed. Secondly a conceptual model for agro-ecosystem representation has been proposed. Based on that and the meta-model, an integrated framework for models integration has been developed using a component-based simulation approach. The OpenMi Java based SDK has been extended to develop the integrated framework. Mimosa scheduler for models simulations has been used to develop the scheduler of the integrated framework. Finally, an integrated framework for agro-ecosystem simulation has been developed. Unlike most integrated platform, the present framework is not restrict to one scale and context. The proposed approach avoids aggregation and disaggregation of information between scales which cause loss of information as in most agriculture models. A case study shows the effectiveness of the framework to simulate the agro-ecosystem of West-Africa at different scales. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper develops a two-stage multi-fidelity simulation optimization framework, containing a low-and high-fidelity process, to address a stochastic objective problem with several stochastic constraints and a huge discrete solution space. The population-based optimization algorithm assisted by the surrogate model is used as a low-fidelity process to reduce the solution space and generate the elite population. Subsequently, we exploit simulation model combined with the optimal computing budget allocation method, as a high-fidelity process, to find the best solution in the elite population. The proposed framework is tested on an optimization problem of medical staff configuration at emergency department in Hong Kong, which is formulated as optimizing the service requirement of urgent patients while satisfying the other service requirements and cost constraint. The experimental results demonstrated that, with a limited labor cost, there is a 52.35% average reduction in the waiting time of urgent patients and a 99.7% reduction in computational time. © 2019, Computers and Industrial Engineering.

abstract={In the manufacturing industry, target-oriented and efficient use of resources is gaining importance, alongside economic optimization. The economic and organizational optimization of manufacturing systems according to the lean principles is only partly compatible with the goals of resource-efficient manufacturing. Therefore, an approach is sought to improve individual analyses of manufacturing systems. This paper proposes an approach for the multi-objective optimization of lean and resource-efficient manufacturing systems. To predict the dynamic effects of several configurations of manufacturing systems, material, energy, and information flows of a discrete event simulation are coupled with an assessment model, based on objectives of lean and resource-efficient manufacturing. Using design of experiments, Gaussian process meta-models are computed for the behavior of the simulation model. These meta-models allow the approximation of the system behavior to be computed in a short period of time and enable extensive multi-objective optimization and more adequate decision-making support systems. The proposed approach is tested in the metalworking industry. © 2020, German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP).},

abstract={In this letter, a reliable procedure for the expedited design optimization of antenna structures by means of trust-region adaptive response scaling (TR-ARS) is proposed. The presented approach exploits two-level electromagnetic (EM) simulation models. A predicted high-fidelity model response is obtained by applying nonlinear frequency and amplitude correction to the low-fidelity model. The surrogate created this way is iteratively rebuilt and optimized within the trust region framework. The utilization of the correlations between the EM models of various fidelities allows for significant reduction of the design optimization cost. The main contributions of the work are twofold: 1) the application of an ARS for antenna optimization (in particular, making it work with coarse-discretization EM models as low-fidelity models); and 2) the integration of an ARS with a TR optimization framework. The operation and performance of the algorithm are demonstrated using two antenna designs optimized for several scenarios. A comparative study reveals computational benefits of the TR-ARS over direct optimization of the high-fidelity EM model. The reliability of the optimization process is further confirmed by an experimental validation of the fabricated antenna prototypes. © 2002-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Momentum-based method and multibody method are often used in accident reconstructions. In this paper, a method that combines momentum-based method and multibody method is presented to analyze a real-world accident with occupant ejection. A multibody model is employed as an effective approach to simulate interaction between vehicle and occupants in the postanalysis of a traffic accident. This model can be used to answer questions that which occupant the driver was, when the accident happened, and the vehicle's speed before occupant ejection. Based on the information of the vehicle turnover location and vehicle speed at the moment of the accident, some unknown parameters of the vehicle before the accident, such as initial speed, acceleration, and vehicle-ground friction coefficient, can be determined. In order to estimate these unknown parameters, a Kriging surrogate model is first constructed for the vehicle movement simulation. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation is then employed to infer the unknown parameters based on the Kriging surrogate model. The results show that a high degree of consistency has been achieved between the computer simulation model and the accident on-scene information. In addition, the injury of occupants in simulation agrees well with conclusions of autopsy report. © Copyright 2019 by ASME.},

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to propose a computationally efficient framework for multi-objective optimization (MO) of antennas involving nested kriging modeling technology. The technique is demonstrated through a two-objective optimization of a planar Yagi antenna and three-objective design of a compact wideband antenna. Design/methodology/approach: The keystone of the proposed approach is the usage of recently introduced nested kriging modeling for identifying the design space region containing the Pareto front and constructing fast surrogate model for the MO algorithm. Surrogate-assisted design refinement is applied to improve the accuracy of Pareto set determination. Consequently, the Pareto set is obtained cost-efficiently, even though the optimization process uses solely high-fidelity electromagnetic (EM) analysis. Findings: The optimization cost is dramatically reduced for the proposed framework as compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks. The initial Pareto set is identified more precisely (its span is wider and of better quality), which is a result of a considerably smaller domain of the nested kriging model and better predictive power of the surrogate. Research limitations/implications: The proposed technique can be generalized to accommodate low- and high-fidelity EM simulations in a straightforward manner. The future work will incorporate variable-fidelity simulations to further reduce the cost of the training data acquisition. Originality/value: The fast MO optimization procedure with the use of the nested kriging modeling technology for approximation of the Pareto set has been proposed and its superiority over state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted procedures has been proved. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this approach to multi-objective antenna optimization is novel and enables obtaining optimal designs cost-effectively even in relatively high-dimensional spaces (considering typical antenna design setups) within wide parameter ranges. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Mechanistic modeling/simulation is quite important and useful for understanding, designing and operating various food processes. However, the rigorous mathematical/mechanistic models are complicated. It is also difficult and time-consuming to determine the parameter values needed for the simulation. Simplified mechanistic models are useful both for the process understanding and for the parameter value determination. In this paper, simplified mechanistic models for two food processes, drying of liquid foods and chromatography of proteins and food materials, are presented. Both of them are diffusion-controlled processes. A short-cut method for determining the water-concentration dependent diffusion coefficient from isothermal drying rates is described. Factors affecting the drying rates and the inactivation of enzyme are explained based on the simplified model. For chromatography separation processes, a method for determining HETP from linear gradient elution (LGE) curves is explained. Then, how to tune separation performance in LGE is described based on the non-dimensional group (Yamamoto number). The productivity calculation methods based on the simplified model is also explained. The usefulness of a non-dimensional group for describing the dynamic binding capacity of the breakthrough curve for capture chromatography is also discussed. © 2019 Japan Society for Food Engineering.},

abstract={Computer simulations often involve both qualitative and numerical inputs. Existing Gaussian process (GP) methods for handling this mainly assume a different response surface for each combination of levels of the qualitative factors and relate them via a multiresponse cross-covariance matrix. We introduce a substantially different approach that maps each qualitative factor to underlying numerical latent variables (LVs), with the mapped values estimated similarly to the other correlation parameters, and then uses any standard GP covariance function for numerical variables. This provides a parsimonious GP parameterization that treats qualitative factors the same as numerical variables and views them as affecting the response via similar physical mechanisms. This has strong physical justification, as the effects of a qualitative factor in any physics-based simulation model must always be due to some underlying numerical variables. Even when the underlying variables are many, sufficient dimension reduction arguments imply that their effects can be represented by a low-dimensional LV. This conjecture is supported by the superior predictive performance observed across a variety of examples. Moreover, the mapped LVs provide substantial insight into the nature and effects of the qualitative factors.

abstract={A new algorithm is developed to tackle the issue of sampling non-Gaussian model parameter posterior probability distributions that arise from solutions to Bayesian inverse problems. The algorithm aims to mitigate some of the hurdles faced by traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers, through constructing proposal probability densities that are both, easy to sample and that provide a better approximation to the target density than a simple Gaussian proposal distribution would. To achieve that, a Gaussian proposal distribution is augmented with a Gaussian Process (GP) surface that helps capture non-linearities in the log-likelihood function. In order to train the GP surface, an iterative approach is adopted for the optimal selection of points in parameter space. Optimality is sought by maximizing the information gain of the GP surface using a minimum number of forward model simulation runs. The accuracy of the GP-augmented surface approximation is assessed in two ways. The first consists of comparing predictions obtained from the approximate surface with those obtained through running the actual simulation model at hold-out points in parameter space. The second consists of a measure based on the relative variance of sample weights obtained from sampling the approximate posterior probability distribution of the model parameters. The efficacy of this new algorithm is tested on inferring reaction rate parameters in a 3-node and 6-node network toy problems, which imitate idealized reaction networks in combustion applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Discontinuous fiber-reinforced Sheet Moulding Compound (SMC) in combination with continuous carbon fiber patches provide a high design freedom in combination with good weight-specific properties. However, the application of these materials requires a strategic and exact positioning of the patches, necessitating the consideration of unavoidable manufacturing defects during the design phase. Therefore, a workflow is proposed to evaluate the robustness of multi-objective patch optimization results using two robustness measures, the degree of robustness and robustness index. An efficient calculation of the robustness measures is achieved by replacing computational expensive simulation models with a Kriging surrogate model. Typical manufacturing deviations occurring during the patch positioning and moulding process are determined from experiments using active thermography. Finally, the proposed workflow is applied to the multi-objective optimization of two patches on a demonstrator under four-point-bending load. The resulting robustness measures can be used as a decision criterion for the selection of the best Pareto optimal solution.

abstract={A simulation model with an outcome Y = m(X) is considered, where X is an R d -valued random variable and m : R d → R is a smooth function. Estimates of the αn -quantile q m(X),α n of m(X) based on surrogate model of m and on importance sampling are constructed which use at most n evaluations of the function m. Results concerning the rate of convergence of the estimates are derived in case that α n → 1 (n→∞) and n ・ (1 − α n ) → 0 (n→ ∞). Finite sample behaviour of the estimates is illustrated by simulations. © 2019, © American Statistical Association and Taylor & Francis 2019.},

abstract={Practical engineering design problems are inherently multiobjective, that is, require simultaneous control of several (and often conflicting) criteria. In many situations, genuine multiobjective optimization is required to acquire comprehensive information about the system of interest. The most popular solution techniques are population-based metaheuristics, however, they are not practical for handling expensive electromagnetic (EM)-simulation models in microwave and antenna engineering. A workaround is to use auxiliary response surface approximation surrogates but it is challenging for higher-dimensional problems. Recently, a deterministic approach has been proposed for expedited multiobjective design optimization of expensive models in computational EMs. The method relies on variable-fidelity EM simulations, tracking the Pareto front geometry, as well as response correction. The algorithm sequentially generates Pareto-optimal designs using a series of constrained single-objective optimizations. The previously obtained design is used as a starting point for the next iteration. In this work, we review this technique and its modification based on space mapping surrogates. We also propose new variations exploiting adjoint sensitivities, as well as response features, which can be attractive depending on availability of derivatives or the characteristics of the system responses that need to be handled. We also discuss several case studies involving various antenna and microwave components. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={In order for biomass drying processes to be efficient, it is crucial to achieve the target residual water content within a close margin, since more conservative drying would result in a waste of energy. A method for a reliable estimation of the water content is therefore of obvious importance. Ideally, such a method does not require any expensive sensors. We show reduced order models and extended Kalman filters can be combined to reliably determine the water content and temperature of wood particles based on only surface temperature measurements. The proposed observer works reliably if measurements are only available for parts of a particle face. It can therefore still be applied if particle surfaces are partially obstructed, which is a prerequisite for use in industrial processes and units, such as rotary dryers. The extended Kalman filter uses a reduced order model that is obtained by applying proper orthogonal decomposition and Galerkin projection to coupled PDEs that model heat conduction and water diffusion in anisotropic particles. In contrast to the original PDE simulation model, the reduced model and the filter based on it are suitable for real time computations and monitoring. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={A reduction gear of an in-wheel motor vehicle is mounted between a traction motor and wheel, to increase the wheel torque and decrease the rotational speed. To improve the energy efficiency of a vehicle, the determination of the optimal gear ratio is an important factor in the design of the reduction gear. This paper presents an optimization procedure to obtain the optimal gear ratio of an in-wheel motor vehicle that minimizes the electric energy consumption. Using a model-based design, a dynamic simulation model of a vehicle was developed for an analysis of the energy efficiency. Owing to a variation in energy efficiency across drivers, a probabilistic driver model that includes driver characteristics is employed. To reduce excessive calculations, a surrogate model was constructed for the optimization. The optimal gear ratio for saving energy was obtained, and the usefulness of the proposed optimization procedure was shown through a comparison of the results of the optimal gear ratio and the energy efficiency achieved between deterministic and probabilistic approaches. © 2018, The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={SiP modules, integrates multi-function components in a package, are widely applied in consumer electronics and IoT, such as Wifi module, GPS module and RF module, etc. Dual side molding module is a more advanced device type, who integrate all the components on the both surfaces of the substrate to effectively reduce the module area. By process strip warpage control is one of the crucial matters for assembly in order to have good yield and high automatic manufacture efficiency. Finite element method is a powerful tool for strip warpage evaluation; however, dual side SiP module strip requires enormous elements to describe its details. A useful model simplification method was proposed in this study. The several layers substrate was simplified as a homogeneous material by numerical tensile and thermal expansion tests to obtain the substrate bulk material properties of modulus and thermal expansion coefficient. The simplified substrate not only helps for efficiency computing, but also can be a transition zone for the different component layout of top and bottom substrate surfaces successfully mesh in the simulation model. Birth and death method was used to investigate by process strip warpage, the evaluation results help to reduce the risk comes from strip warpage. According to the well validated simulation model, for process improvement, firstly SMT and molding top side has better performance for strip warpage; for EMC improvement, bottom side choose high shrinkage EMC or top side select low shrinkage EMC can well control strip warpage. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Information regarding the best possible design trade-offs of an antenna structure can be obtained through multiobjective optimisation (MO). Unfortunately, MO is extremely challenging if full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation models are used for performance evaluation. Yet, for the majority of contemporary antennas, EM analysis is the only tool that ensures reliability. This study introduces a procedure for accelerated MO design of antennas that exploits cheap data-driven surrogates, as well as MO evolutionary algorithm to yield an initial approximation of the Pareto set. The final Pareto set is found using output space mapping. The major contribution of this work is a further reduction of the computational cost of surrogate model construction using a design space segmentation mechanism, where a part of the space containing the Pareto front is first identified by means of single-objective optimisation runs and subsequently represented by a set of adjacent compartments with separate surrogate models established within them. Segmentation allows for significant reduction of the number of training points necessary to build a reliable surrogate and thus the overall optimisation cost. The presented technique is demonstrated using two antenna structures and compared with a state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted techniques. Experimental validation is also provided. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018.},

abstract={This paper provides an effective model for ontology-based integrated control design to solve the design problems in controls of hypersonic vehicles and its shape optimization. It is known that that the direct integration design based on nonlinear model poses difficult questions and further the design based on the simple linear model does not reflect the dynamic characteristics of the cruising hypersonic vehicles with wide flight envelope. So a changing parameter surrogate modeling method for the integrated design of hypersonic vehicle is proposed in this paper, which is an accurate intrinsic model for the ontology-based integrated control for the optimization of the design of hypersonic vehicle. This modeling method is a complete process, which involves building a model, simulation under various parameters, and verification of the results. Parameter classification algorithm is used to evaluate the modeling process, and at last a linear parameter varying model containing multiple parameters, such as flight conditions and ontology features, are established. Finally, the proposed modeling method is applied to the reference vehicle, and the simulation results show that the model reflects the nonlinear characteristics of the original object.

abstract={To solve the problem of the DC bias of transformer by earth-return mode of HVDC systems, and to improve the performance limitation of traditional DC ground electrodes, we proposed a design scheme of distributed HVDC ground electrodes. Meanwhile, we established three simulation models, namely a complete model, a simplified model and a pure circuit model. Taking the ground electrodes in Yichang in Hubei Province as an example, we calculated the distributed HVDC ground electrodes. The results show that the complete model and simplified model have achieved consistent results, while the results of the pure circuit model deviate from the true solution. Error of the pure circuit model depends on the ratio of the mutual resistance between the sub electrodes to the grounding resistance of the sub electrodes. Moreover, the four independent ground electrodes in Hubei Power Grid are taken as research objects, and the DC current of single ground electrode can be reduced by 16% and the maximum surface potential around the ground electrode can be reduced by 24.9% by using simple linear distributed grounding poles. The method can provide a reference for the application of distributed ground electrodes in AC-DC hybrid power grid. © 2019, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

abstract={This contribution summarizes the design and analysis of experiments with computerized simulation models. It focuses on two metamodel (surrogate, emulator) types, namely first-order or second-order polynomial regression, and Kriging (or Gaussian process). The metamodel type determines the design of the simulation experiment, which determines the input combinations of the simulation model. Before applying these metamodels, the analysts should screen the many inputs of a realistic simulation model; this contribution focuses on sequential bifurcation. Optimization of the simulated system may use either a sequence of first-order and second-order polynomials—so-called response surface methodology (RSM)—or Kriging models fitted through sequential designs—including efficient global optimization (EGO). Robust optimization accounts for uncertainty in some simulation inputs. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={As the size of western Canadian farms increase and the productivity demands on seeding equipment rise, improvement in the depth consistency performance of seeding implements at higher seeding speeds is a future focus of equipment designers. The objective of this work was to develop a dynamic simulation tool for predicting the motion of a hoe-opener style seeding implement with independent row units. The model was developed using simple low-order models available in the literature to compute the forces generated at soil-tire and soil-tool interfaces. By maintaining low computational cost, early-stage parameter sensitivity and design trade-off studies can assess the risk of a given design change. The amplitude of the power spectral density (PSD) of simulated row unit motion was typically lower with sharper peaks than measured results up to 3.3 m/s; these differences were due to both input amplitude differences, and the sensitivity of the model itself. Frequency agreement of major measured and simulated PSD peaks was acceptable considering the model simplifications. Row unit motion was dominated by two phenomena – a strong periodic input in the terrain surface, and feedback between the hoe-opener and packer wheel of the row unit. © 2017 ISTVS},

abstract={The internal flow field study of car compartments is an important step in railroad vehicle design and optimization. The flow field profile has a significant impact on the temperature distribution and passenger comfort level. Experimental studies on flow field can yield accurate results but carry a high time and computational cost. In contrast, the numerical simulation method can yield an internal flow field profile in less time than an experimental study. This study aims to improve the computational efficiency of numerical simulation by adapting two simplified models—the porous media model and the porous jump face model—to study the internal flow field of a railroad car compartment. The results provided by both simplified models are compared with the original numerical simulation model and with experimental data. Based on the results, the porous media model has a better agreement with the original model and with the experimental results. The flow field parameters (temperature and velocity) of the porous media model have relatively small numerical errors, with a maximum numerical error of 4.7%. The difference between the numerical results of the original model and those of the porous media model is less than 1%. By replacing the original numerical simulation model with the porous media model, the flow field of subway car compartments can be calculated with a reduction of about 25% in computing resources, while maintaining good accuracy. © 2019 THE AUTHORS},

abstract={The adjoint method has been used significantly for parameter estimation. This requires a significant programming effort to build adjoint model code and is computationally expensive as cost of one adjoint simulation often exceeds several original model runs. The work proposed here is variational data assimilation based on balanced proper orthogonal decomposition (BPOD) to identify uncertain parameters in numerical models and avoids the implementation of the adjoint with respect to model input parameters. An ensemble of model simulations (forward and backward) is used to determine the model subspace while considering both inputs and outputs of the system. By projecting the original model onto this subspace an approximate linear reduced model is obtained. The adjoint of the tangent linear model is replaced by the adjoint of linear reduced model and the minimization problem is then solved in the reduced space at very low computational cost. The performance of the method are illustrated with a number of data assimilation experiments in a 2D-advection diffusion model. The results demonstrate that the BPOD based estimation approach successfully estimates the diffusion coefficient for both advection and diffusion dominated problems. The paper also proposes an efficient method for computing the observable subspace when the number of observations is large is also proposed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Safety is a primary concern for the various transport means. For sea transport, this includes various aspects like human safety at sea and at port, and also environmental safety and sustainability. In heavy-traffic regions where the waters are congested and vessels sail very closely together, ensuring these safety needs can be challenging. In this paper, we leverage on the rich information transmitted through the automatic identification system (AIS) and propose, for the first time, an integrated simulation-optimization approach for real time collision avoidance. This enables capturing of stochastic dynamic behavior of vessels for better prediction and fast trajectory optimization for application in real time. Specifically, a realistic agent-based model is developed based on behavioral learning in a real-environment, and incorporated into a fast collision avoidance optimization model in real time to provide robust collision avoidance that is able to account for future stochastic consequences of the actions taken. To achieve this, we develop: 1) a vessel pattern recognition method that mines the rich AIS data to produce realistic trajectory models; 2) an agent-based simulation model to enhance future trajectory prediction; and 3) a fast surrogate-based sampling technique to generate collision avoidance maneuvers for vessel captains in real time. To illustrate the feasibility of the approach, we use the case of the Singapore strait, one of the busiest straits in the world. © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={A two-stage Internet data center (IDC)-considered framework in generation and transmission expansion planning (GTEP) (referred to as IGTEP) is proposed to make full use of IDCs' spatial and chronological load regulation potentials for demand response. Stage one aggregates the data network (DN) to match a transmission network structure. First, IDC load is modeled based on the DN configuration. Second, the aggregated DN (ADN) is proposed to model DN with aggregated front-end servers (FSs) and data flows, where an intuitively accurate mathematical relationship among IDCs is developed. Third, the virtual power network (VPN) is proposed to provide a model for ADN with electrical variables, where the coupling of DN and power network (PN) is proposed to develop a linear aggregated IDC load model. Stage two coordinates IDC DR and GTEP, in which the load coupling among multiple IDCs is managed by VPN and the corresponding IDC load model is compatible with the conventional GTEP load. Simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed VPN and IDC load model. Simulation results also show that IDC DR may reduce the total IGTEP cost significantly, which implies that DN can play a role equivalent to power lines and generators in power system planning and operations. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The emergency communication system based on rail is an unconventional emergency communication mode, it is a complement equipment for that conventional communication system can’t work while tunnel mine accident occurs. Medium of transmission channel is the widely existing rail in the tunnel. In this paper we analyzed the characteristics of the rail transmission channel, verified the feasibility that information is transmitted by vibration signal in rail, we proposed the realization plan of the system. Communication protocol and processing mechanism suitable for rail transmission are designed according to the characteristics of channel bandwidth and low data transmission. Information communication with low bit rate and low bit error is realized in the communication simulation model. In the simplified model, we realized to transmit recognition speech information, and the error rate of the key text information is low to accept. The most concerned problem of personnel location in the mine disaster rescue is proposed, the composite algorithm is based on the model of signal amplitude attenuation, key node information and data frame transmission delay. Location information of hitting point can be achieved within the simplified model of the experiment. Furthermore, we discuss the characteristics of vibration signals passing through different channels. Copyright © 2018 Tech Science Press.},

abstract={Sensitivity analyses (SA), being used to identify the most influential inputs of simulation models, are still rarely conducted for offshore wind turbines (OWTs). If SA are performed, in most cases, no reasons for the choice of the method are given and the selection is based on expert knowledge only. Objective criteria are not applied. Frequently, simplified SA are utilized, e.g. one-at-a-time analyses, although it is known that these approaches are not suitable for non-linear or stochastic systems. Sophisticated SA, like variance-based methods, are time-consuming and limited suitable for OWT models. As a consequence, here, the performance of various SA methods of different complexity in the context of structural analyses of OWTs is investigated. The analyzed methods range from simple testing of parameter constellations, to elementary effects and meta-model-based approaches, all the way to variance-based approaches. Objective recommendations with regard to the most suitable SA methods for OWT analyses based on the two criteria, accuracy and computing time, are given. Results show that neither plain linear SA (not selecting the right probabilistic subset) nor variance-based approaches (being computational inefficient) are the best choice, but meta-model-based approaches represent the recommended compromise. Furthermore, challenges of SA for stochastic systems are highlighted. © 2019 European Safety and Reliability Association. Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.},

abstract={Nowadays, liberalized energy markets give priority to power generation using renewable energy sources (RES) to minimize environmental impact and promote competitiveness. Demand changes and the variability caused by RES are two obstacles in achieving a stable electricity generation. In this context, operational strategies are the key to achieve a more stable and balanced energy generation. Such operational strategies are characterized by operation profiles which show valve operations that takes the plant from an initial state to a final state by means of a series of state variables transitions. Some work has been published in the literature that focuses on the coupling of simulation and optimization. However, this approach involves many iterations, demanding significant computation time. In this paper, a machine-learning approach is proposed that can be used to replace the rigorous simulation model with a surrogate model, which is obtained in short period of time and reduces dramatically the simulation time. The proposed approach has been initially tested in a case study that focuses on the generation of operation profiles of a hydraulic system composed of three interconnected tanks whose level changes are achieved by control valve manipulations and its operation is analogous to some power-plant components (e.g. drum boiler) in terms of valve manipulations. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={A combination of the Kriging surrogate model and the genetic and particle swarm optimization (GA-PSO) algorithm was applied to the design and optimization of the U-shaped electro-thermal actuator with large displacement, based on the local function with four parameters. The multi-physical coupling simulation model of the U-shaped electro-thermal actuator was established and validated by experiment. The displacement from simulation shows a good agreement with that from experiment with different voltages, which ensures the accuracy of the sample data for the Kriging model. A co-simulation using ANSYS and MATLAB was created, which can capture the sample data in batches. The simple random sampling was utilized to get sample points. The displacements of different sample points were obtained as sample data. The Kriging model was established with the sample data and the GA-PSO algorithm was used for optimization based on the established Kriging model. Results show that the Kriging model can replace the simulation model for predicting the displacement of the U-shaped actuator precisely. The monotonic relationship exists between the displacement and each of the four key parameters, which can decide the shape of the actuator. The displacement of the U-shaped actuator increases 35.2% under 18 V after the shape optimization. Copyright ©2018 Journal of Zhejiang University (Engineering Science). All rights reserved.},

abstract={Bioelectrical patterns are established by spatiotemporal correlations of cell membrane potentials at the multicellular level, being crucial to development, regeneration, and tumorigenesis. We have conducted multicellular simulations on bioelectrical community effects and intercellular coupling in multicellular aggregates. The simulations aim at establishing under which conditions a local heterogeneity consisting of a small patch of cells can be stabilized against a large aggregate of surrounding identical cells which are in a different bioelectrical state. In this way, instructive bioelectrical information can be persistently encoded in spatiotemporal patterns of separated domains with different cell polarization states. The multicellular community effects obtained are regulated both at the single-cell and intercellular levels, and emerge from a delicate balance between the degrees of intercellular coupling in: (i) the small patch, (ii) the surrounding bulk, and (iii) the interface that separates these two regions. The model is experimentally motivated and consists of two generic voltage-gated ion channels that attempt to establish the depolarized and polarized cell states together with coupling conductances whose individual and intercellular different states permit a dynamic multicellular connectivity. The simulations suggest that community effects may allow the reprogramming of single-cell bioelectrical states, in agreement with recent experimental data. A better understanding of the resulting electrical regionalization can assist the electroceutical correction of abnormally depolarized regions initiated in the bulk of normal tissues as well as suggest new biophysical mechanisms for the establishment of target patterns in multicellular engineering. © 2020 American Physical Society.},

abstract={This study aims to the industrial scale development of Bauxite Residue leaching for Scandium recovery, by optimizing a hydrometallurgy method and taking account appropriate design concepts for process intensification. Approaching the design issue either by adapting arithmetic methods, or using related software, showed inconsistent convergence, which is caused by the process particularities and non-conventional characteristics (i.e., feed flow-rates dependent on reflux ratio, hybrid of continuous and intermittent processes, etc.). Seeking also for process economic viability, typical cost-based objective functions showed to deviate from optima with a real economic sense. To deal with both challenges, necessary modeling simplification for advanced Leaching with Mineral Acids (LMA) was made, coupled with commercial economics and profit-based objective functions. Under the design aspect, additional constraints were introduced for the Pregnant Leach Solution (PLS) that were arisen from the subsequent Resin ion eXchange (RX) and the avoiding of colloidal silica gel formation. The optimized leaching resulted to the highest possible: solids-to-liquid ratio; molarity for RX-complying PLS; and temperature for acceptable [Si] (e.g., SL = 33.3 %, CFA = 0.31 M, TL = 32 °C, PL = 1 atm, N = 1.01, τL≥1 h). Also, the developed simulation model can have expanded application for different LMA cases, and the introduced economic evaluation method is suitable for the production of various internationally traded commodities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Within the context of exoskeleton applications for rehabilitation of patients with partial spinal cord injury, there is a degree of actuator variety used to promote and control human gait movements. To study possible actuator alternatives, it is necessary to know the torques acting in the lower limbs joints during the gait cycle. This work’s objective is to obtain such required joint torques in a low speed gait scenario, in order to address rehabilitation gait in future works. A non-linear dynamical model capable of describing a simplified human gait dynamics is developed and implemented for simulation. Kinematic data retrieved from both scientific literature and experimental tests conducted by the research team are used as input to an inverse dynamics analysis of gait at the same low speed, allowing the validation and study of the limitations of the proposed model. Simulation results show that the developed model shares the shape and scale of the reference data and remains between its standard deviation limits. Therefore, it can be concluded that even with the data limitations of reference literature, statistical deviation of the experimental tests and modeling simplifications, the developed dynamical model presents satisfactory results. Future works will focus on experimental gait tests at rehabilitation speeds, which are slower than the speed of this paper, to allow a more complete validation of the model for such cases. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Recon Fires is a concept whereby military units manoeuvre on the battlespace to elicit a response from an unknown enemy. One key question about the implementation of this concept is: “how many Recon Fires missions can a generic unit perform before becoming operationally unviable?” To investigate this, a multi-method approach combining seminar wargaming, closed-loop simulation and Markov modelling and analysis was used. Previous studies that have taken a similar approach generally conclude with statistical analysis of the data from the closed-loop simulation. An advantage of taking the additional step of generating a Markov Chain was that only a single typical Recon Fires Mission needed to be modelled, reducing the time to develop the closed-loop simulation model. This in turn gave quicker turn-around on results and allowed greater exploration of “what if” situations. The seminar wargame allowed the Recon Fires aspects to be isolated from the broader operation and gave initial insights into the concept. It also provided the key data required to construct a closed-loop simulation. The closed-loop simulation was then run multiple times for different starting states. Each starting state represented a different strength of the force before it began a Recon Fires mission. The generated data was analysed directly and used to construct the Markov Chain. The Markov Chain was then analysed to find the mean time until the generic unit became operationally unviable. © MODSIM 2009.All rights reserved.},

abstract={Virtual design studies for the dynamics of structures that undergo large deformations, such as wind turbine blades or Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), can be a tedious task. Such studies are usually done with finite element simulations. The equations of motion that result from the finite element discretization typically are high-dimensional and nonlinear. This leads to high computation costs because the high-dimensional nonlinear stiffness term and its Jacobian must be evaluated at each Newton-Raphson iteration during time integration. Model reduction can overcome this burden by reducing the high-dimensional model to a smaller problem. This is done in two steps: First, a Galerkin projection on a reduction basis, and, second, hyperreduction of the geometric nonlinear restoring force term. The first step, namely finding a proper reduction basis, can be performed by either simulation-based or simulation-free methods. While simulation-based methods, such as the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), rely on costly preliminary simulations of full high-dimensional models, simulation-free methods are much cheaper in computation. For this reason, simulation-free methods are more desirable for design studies where the amount of the so called ‘offline costs’ for reduction of the high-dimensional model are of high interest. However, simulation-free reduction bases are dependent on the system’s properties, and thus depend on design parameters that typically change for each design iteration. This dependence must be taken into account if the parameter space of interest is large. This contribution shows how design iterations can be performed without the need for expensive simulations of the high-dimensional model. We propose to sample the parameter space, compute simulation-free reduction bases at the sample points and interpolate the bases at new parameter points. As hyperreduction technique, the Energy Conserving Sampling and Weighting method and the Polynomial expansion are used for hyperreduction of the nonlinear term. In this step, we also avoid simulations of the high-dimensional nonlinear model. The coefficients of the hyperreduction are updated in each design iteration for the new reduction bases. A simple case study of a shape parameterized beam shows the performance of the proposed method. The case study also accounts for a last challenge that occurs in models that are parametric in shape: The topology of the finite element mesh must be maintained during the design iterations. We face this challenge by using mesh morphing techniques. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc 2021.},

abstract={An emulator is a fast-to-evaluate statistical approximation of a detailed mathematical model (simulator). When used in lieu of simulators, emulators can expedite tasks that require many repeated evaluations, such as sensitivity analyses, policy optimization, model calibration, and value-of-information analyses. Emulators are developed using the output of simulators at specific input values (design points). Developing an emulator that closely approximates the simulator can require many design points, which becomes computationally expensive. We describe a self-terminating active learning algorithm to efficiently develop emulators tailored to a specific emulation task, and compare it with algorithms that optimize geometric criteria (random latin hypercube sampling and maximum projection designs) and other active learning algorithms (treed Gaussian Processes that optimize typical active learning criteria). We compared the algorithms' root mean square error (RMSE) and maximum absolute deviation from the simulator (MAX) for seven benchmark functions and in a prostate cancer screening model. In the empirical analyses, in simulators with greatly varying smoothness over the input domain, active learning algorithms resulted in emulators with smaller RMSE and MAX for the same number of design points. In all other cases, all algorithms performed comparably. The proposed algorithm attained satisfactory performance in all analyses, had smaller variability than the treed Gaussian Processes, and, on average, had similar or better performance as the treed Gaussian Processes in six out of seven benchmark functions and in the prostate cancer model. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={In this article, a simple yet efficient and reliable technique for fully automated multi-objective design optimization of antenna structures using sequential domain patching (SDP) is discussed. The optimization procedure according to SDP is a two-step process: (i) obtaining the initial set of Pareto-optimal designs representing the best possible trade-offs between considered conflicting objectives, and (ii) Pareto set refinement for yielding the optimal designs at the high-fidelity electromagnetic (EM) simulation model level. For the sake of computational efficiency, the first step is realized at the level of a low-fidelity (coarse-discretization) EM model by sequential construction and relocation of small design space segments (patches) in order to create a path connecting the extreme Pareto front designs obtained beforehand. The second stage involves response correction techniques and local response surface approximation models constructed by reusing EM simulation data acquired in the first step. A major contribution of this work is an automated procedure for determining the patch dimensions. It allows for appropriate selection of the number of patches for each geometry variable so as to ensure reliability of the optimization process while maintaining its low cost. The importance of this procedure is demonstrated by comparing it with uniform patch dimensions. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Core heterogeneity is an important factor influencing CO2 and brine migration in porous media but difficult to be accurately described using models. In this study, we quantitatively evaluate the effects of the errors between core heterogeneity and the simplified models on numerical modeling of CO2 core flooding. Results indicate: 1) The model error from the 1D simplification of 3D petrophysical heterogeneity could make the multiphase flow modeling fail to reflect the mean behavior of the core plug, and the resultant deviations in the averaged CO2 saturation (SCO2) can span from -0.1 to 0.2. Besides, using the 1D heterogeneous core model in the modeling generally conceals the local SCO2 buildup and accordingly clouds judgment about variation trend of the local SCO2. 2) The settings of the local petrophysical properties for the low-porosity heterogeneous structures in the cores have a significant impact on the predicted SCO2 distribution in front of these structures. Particularly, the errors in their capillary entry pressure could lead to the significant underestimation of the local SCO2 near them. Consequently, the model outputs cannot reflect the local SCO2 buildup behavior. 3) Both magnitude and variation trend of the predicted local SCO2 could be numerically sensitive to 3D heterogeneity distribution, notably increasing the probability of the mismatching between model predictions and experimental observations. Comparatively, more efforts should be paid to the parameter setting of the heterogeneous structures in order to improve the reliability of the CO2 core flooding modeling. © 2019},

abstract={Reduced order models (ROMs) can be simulated with lower computational cost while being more amenable to theoretical analysis. Here, we examine the performance of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), a data-driven model reduction technique. We show that the accuracy of ROMs obtained using POD depends on the type of data used and, more crucially, on the criterion used to select the number of proper orthogonal modes (POMs) used for the model. Simulations of a simply supported Euler-Bernoulli beam subjected to periodic impulsive loads are used to generate ROMs via POD, which are then simulated for comparison with the full system. We assess the accuracy of ROMs obtained using steady-state displacement, velocity, and strain fields, tuning the spatiotemporal localization of applied impulses to control the number of excited modes in, and hence the dimensionality of, the system's response. We show that conventional variance-based mode selection leads to inaccurate models for sufficiently impulsive loading and that this poor performance is explained by the energy imbalance on the reduced subspace. Specifically, the subspace of POMs capturing a fixed amount (say, 99.9%) of the total variance underestimates the energy input and dissipated in the ROM, yielding inaccurate reduced-order simulations. This problem becomes more acute as the loading becomes more spatio-temporally localized (more impulsive). Thus, energy closure analysis provides an improved method for generating ROMs with energetics that properly reflect that of the full system, resulting in simulations that accurately represent the system's true behavior. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

abstract={Sustainable management of groundwater resources under changing climatic conditions require an application of reliable and accurate predictions of groundwater levels. Mechanistic multi-scale, multi-physics simulation models are often too hard to use for this purpose, especially for groundwater managers who do not have access to the complex compute resources and data. Therefore, we analyzed the applicability and performance of four modern deep learning computational models for predictions of groundwater levels. We compare three methods for optimizing the models’ hyperparameters, including two surrogate model-based algorithms and a random sampling method. The models were tested using predictions of the groundwater level in Butte County, California, USA, taking into account the temporal variability of streamflow, precipitation, and ambient temperature. Our numerical study shows that the optimization of the hyperparameters can lead to reasonably accurate performance of all models (root mean squared errors of groundwater predictions of 2 meters or less), but the “simplest” network, namely a multilayer perceptron (MLP) performs overall better for learning and predicting groundwater data than the more advanced long short-term memory or convolutional neural networks in terms of prediction accuracy and time-to-solution, making the MLP a suitable candidate for groundwater prediction. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.},

abstract={In this paper, a universal design for the LLC resonant converter with fixed switching frequency is proposed. In order to realize zero voltage switching (ZVS) and zero current switching (ZCS), the fixed switching frequency is selected slightly lower than the resonant frequency. Subsequently, the simplified model of LLC resonant converter is derived based on the fundamental harmonic approximation (FHA) method, and the relationship among voltage gain, the inductance ratio lambda and the quality factor pmbQ in frequency domain is analyzed. Based on this, a universal design of resonance tank parameters is given, and a simulation model is built in Saber. Finally, the simulation results well verify the effectiveness of the design method. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Cardiac contraction is the result of integrated cellular, tissue and organ function. Biophysical in silico cardiac models offer a systematic approach for studying these multi-scale interactions. The computational cost of such models is high, due to their multi-parametric and nonlinear nature. This has so far made it difficult to perform model fitting and prevented global sensitivity analysis (GSA) studies. We propose a machine learning approach based on Gaussian process emulation of model simulations using probabilistic surrogate models, which enables model parameter inference via a Bayesian history matching (HM) technique and GSA on whole-organ mechanics. This framework is applied to model healthy and aortic-banded hypertensive rats, a commonly used animal model of heart failure disease. The obtained probabilistic surrogate models accurately predicted the left ventricular pump function (R 2 = 0.92 for ejection fraction). The HM technique allowed us to fit both the control and diseased virtual bi-ventricular rat heart models to magnetic resonance imaging and literature data, with model outputs from the constrained parameter space falling within 2 SD of the respective experimental values. The GSA identified Troponin C and cross-bridge kinetics as key parameters in determining both systolic and diastolic ventricular function.

abstract={In order to characterize the physical properties of IGBT accurately, based on the typical IGBT switching transient model, we proposed an improved transient characteristics model for high voltage IGBT structure. Firstly, based on the theory of semiconductor physics, the modeling process of a typical IGBT switching transient model was analyzed and calculated briefly. According to the wide base region's feature of high voltage IGBT structure, an improved IGBT transient model was proposed, in which the effect of the base region recombination process on the IGBT switching transient was considered. Finally, an improved model was realized in the simulation software of Saber, and the simulation of double pulse was carried out at 25 degree and 125 degree conditions. In order to verify the improved transient model, the test circuit with a 3 300 V/1 200 A IGBT module was set up. And the experimental results show that, under the 25 degree condition, the improved model reduces the error of IGBT's turn-off time from 26.5% to 1.5% and the error of IGBT's turn-off loss from 60.93% to 8.92%. Under the 125 degree condition, the improved model reduces the error of IGBT's turn-off time from 14.5% to 4% and the error of IGBT's turn-off loss from 61.68% to 11.35%. As a result, the improved model provides a more accurate simulation model for the application of IGBT. © 2018, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI. All right reserved.},

abstract={Escalating salinity levels in the Bonriki aquifer due to unplanned groundwater extraction is a major concern for the people of Kiribati. A multiobjective management model capable of providing sustainable optimal groundwater pumping strategies and simultaneously confining salinity concentrations in the aquifer within specified limits is needed for the Bonriki aquifer system. This study applies a regional-scale linked simulation-optimization (S/O) methodology with a Pareto front clustering technique to prescribe optimal groundwater withdrawal patterns from the Bonriki aquifer. A numerical simulation model is calibrated and validated using available field data. For computational feasibility, support vector regression (SVR) surrogate models are trained and tested utilizing input-output data sets generated using the numerical flow and transport simulation model. The developed surrogate models were externally coupled with the multiobjective genetic algorithm optimization (MOGA) model as a substitute for the numerical model. The study area consisted of freshwater pumping wells for extracting groundwater for beneficial use. Pumping from barrier wells installed along the coastlines were also considered as a management option to hydraulically control saltwater intrusion. The executed multiobjective linked S/O model generated 700 Pareto-optimal solutions. Analyzing a large set of Pareto-optimal solutions is a challenging task for the decision maker. Hence, the k-means clustering technique is utilized to reduce the larger original Pareto-optimal solution set for solving the large-scale saltwater intrusion management problem in Bonriki. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Kriging (or a Gaussian process) provides metamodels for deterministic and random simulation models. Actually, there are several types of Kriging; the classic type is the so-called universal Kriging, which includes ordinary Kriging. These classic types require estimation of the trend in the input-output data of the underlying simulation model; this estimation weakens the Kriging metamodel. We therefore consider the so-called intrinsic Kriging (IK), which originated in geostatistics, and derive IK types for deterministic simulations and random simulations, respectively. Moreover, for random simulations, we derive experimental designs that specify the number of replications that varies with the input combination of the simulation model. To compare the performance of IK and classic Kriging, we use several numerical experiments with deterministic simulations and random simulations, respectively. These experiments show that IK gives better metamodels, in most experiments. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Simulation modeling has been leveraged for a variety of health care applications. Data used to inform most parameters for these models are typically collected from a single site, thus limiting the generalizability of the results and insights for other populations. In this study, we explore the impact of using data collected from multiple sites to parameterize an agent-based model of multidrug-resistant organisms in an intensive care unit setting. We show that using single sites to inform model parameters can be highly variable, and that using multiple sites can significantly improve the precision of these estimates and reduce the associated aggregated model error. © 2018 “IISE”.},

abstract={Model-driven engineering has become popular in the combat effectiveness simulation systems engineering during these last years. It allows to systematically develop a simulation model in a composable way. However, implementing a conceptual model is really a complex and costly job if this is not guided under a well-established framework. Hence this study attempts to explore methodologies for engineering the development of simulation models. For this purpose, we define an ontological metamodelling framework. This framework starts with ontology-aware system conceptual descriptions, and then refines and transforms them toward system models until they reach final executable implementations. As a proof of concept, we identify a set of ontology-aware modelling frameworks in combat systems specification, then an underwater targets search scenario is presented as a motivating example for running simulations and results can be used as a reference for decision-making behaviors. © 2020, DESIDOC},

abstract={To accurately predict the reliability of a physical system under aleatory (i.e., irreducible) uncertainty in system performance, a very large number of physical output test data is required. Alternatively, a simulation-based method can be used to assess reliability, but it remains a challenge as it involves epistemic (i.e., reducible) uncertainties due to imperfections in input distribution models, simulation models, and surrogate models. In practical engineering applications, only a limited number of tests are used to model input distribution. Thus, estimated input distribution models are uncertain. As a result, estimated output distributions, which are the outcomes of input distributions and biased simulation models, and the corresponding reliabilities also become uncertain. Furthermore, only a limited number of output testing is used due to its cost, which results in epistemic uncertainty. To deal with epistemic uncertainties in prediction of reliability, a confidence concept is introduced to properly assess conservative reliability by considering all epistemic uncertainties due to limited numbers of both input test data (i.e., input uncertainty) and output test data (i.e., output uncertainty), biased simulation models, and surrogate models. One way to treat epistemic uncertainties due to limited numbers of both input and output test data and biased models is to use a hierarchical Bayesian approach. However, the hierarchical Bayesian approach could result in an overly conservative reliability assessment by integrating possible candidates of input distribution using a Bayesian analysis. To tackle this issue, a new confidence-based reliability assessment method that reduces unnecessary conservativeness is developed in this paper. In the developed method, the epistemic uncertainty induced by a limited number of input data is treated by approximating an input distribution model using a bootstrap method. Two engineering examples are used to demonstrate that 1) the proposed method can predict the reliability of a physical system that satisfies the user-specified target confidence level and 2) the proposed confidence-based reliability is less conservative than the one that fully integrates possible candidates of input distribution models in the hierarchical Bayesian analysis.

abstract={Philosophical reflection on and around Modeling and Simulation (M&S) is often focused on the ethical and epistemological implications of empirical findings or innovative methods within the field. In this paper I highlight some of the metaphysical implications of developments within M&S. I argue that the rise of simulation within and across scientific disciplines is accelerating the reversal of Platonism, whose emphasis on transcendence and reliance on hierarchical, static categories has dominated western philosophy for over two millennia. The success of M&S methodologies opens up new conceptual space for articulating a metaphysics of immanence that may provide a more adequate basis for understanding and solving many of the problems facing contemporary human societies. © 2019 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

abstract={Concepts for aggregate modeling and simulation are presented and applied for the setting of the parameters of a CONWIP flow control system within the steel products cell at Grand Rapids Chair, a high-mix, low-volume manufacturing environment. Aggregation was accomplished by combining the over 100 types of products into one. This resulted in a single arrival process, routing modeled as random movement through workstations, and a single operation time distribution for each production operation. Aggregation reduced the effort required for model development, data analysis, validation, and simulation. The CONWIP control was shown to be effective in managing the work-in-process. A CONWIP parameter of 50 resulted in an equivalent throughput to that achieved with no limit on work-in-process. Lead time can be reduced by approximately 20% by increasing the CONWIP parameter to 58. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

abstract={The obesity epidemic has increasingly spread around the world in the past two decades. Data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have shown the prevalence of US adult obesity doubling during this period. Also, the obesity rate reached all-time high, with more than one-third (36.5 percent) of the adult population being obese in 2017. This rapid increase in the prevalence of adult obesity may be attributed to the changes in human behavior and environment. This study was designed to identify the important risk factors that contributed to the US adult obesity rate and quantify the effect of changing a specific key factor on the reduction of the adult obesity rate, in consideration of other risk factors. It was hypothesized that at least one of the risk factors-behavioral factors, socioeconomic status, food environment, and physical environment-contributed to US adult obesity rate. The simulation using full and reduced models of linear regression and partial least squares regression was constructed to determine the relationship between the US county-level adult obesity rate and its multiple risk factors. Of the twenty-three risk factors related to adult obesity, the top three risk factors with high correlation in tornado charts were identified in both full and reduced models in simulation as physical inactivity, median household income, and percent of children eligible for free lunch program. The study showed that adult obesity rate was most influenced by behavioral factors, followed by socioeconomic status and physical environment. Also, the results of sensitivity analysis indicated that if physical inactivity for adults decreases by 5 percent-from 30 percent to 25 percent-the adult obesity rate would drop to 28 percent from the rate of 30 percent in 2013. The research findings in this study were consistent with the literature reviews, indicating that the simulation modeling approach was robust and applicable to inform population-based intervention strategies. © Common Ground Research Networks, Chau-Kuang Chen, All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={In contemporary practices, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based tools are increasingly applied to build high fidelity First Principles based Models (FPMs) for designing tactical missile systems. However, optimization, sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification using such models still remain to be extremely tedious and, hence, are performed offline. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are known to be efficient machine learning based models capable of modelling large amount of nonlinearities in the data. However, heuristics involved in their modelling prevent their application as surrogate models to computationally intensive FPMs. In this work, a novel algorithm, aimed at simultaneous optimal estimation of architecture (number of hidden layers and nodes in each layer), training sample size and activation function in ANNs is proposed. The proposed algorithm classifies as a generic multi-objective evolutionary neural architecture search strategy to design ANNs. It is solved using the population based evolutionary optimization algorithm called Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II. The high fidelity data to train the ANNs are obtained from CFD model for simulating supersonic flow over a tactical missile body in ANSYS Fluent ©. The obtained ANNs with a test set accuracy of around 99% are then used for quantifying uncertainties, due to order of discretization, flux and Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model in CFD simulations, on the coefficients of lift, drag and rolling moment using the method of analysis of variance (ANOVA). The applicability of optimally designed MLP surrogates for performing ANOVA based study presents novel insights into the epistemic uncertainties arising due to the CFD model which can help in realistic designs of tactical missiles.},

abstract={Let X be an Rd valued random variable, let m : Rd → R be a measurable function and set Y = m(X). Given a sample of (X, Y) of size n, we consider the problem of estimating the quantile of Y of a given level α ∈ (0, 1). A method for choosing the parameter of a surrogate model of m is introduced, and it is shown that the corresponding surrogate quantile estimate achieves the rate of convergence bounded by the sum of the minimal rate of convergence of the quantile estimates corresponding to the given surrogate estimates and a term of order log(n)/n. The finite sample size behavior of this quantile estimate is illustrated by applying it to simulated data and to a quantile estimation problem in mechanical engineering. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper focuses on efficient computational optimization algorithms for the generation of micro electro discharge machining (μEDM) tool shapes. In a previous paper, the authors presented a reliable reverse modeling approach to perform such tasks based on a crater-by-crater simulation model and an outer optimization loop. Two-dimensional results were obtained but 3D tool shapes proved difficult to generate due to the high numerical cost of the simulation strategy. In this paper, a new reduced modeling optimization framework is proposed, whereby the computational optimizer is replaced by an inexpensive surrogate that is trained by examples. More precisely, an artificial neural network (ANN) is trained using a small number of full reverse simulations and subsequently used to directly generate optimal tool shapes, given the geometry of the desired workpiece cavity. In order to train the ANN efficiently, a method of data augmentation is developed, whereby multiple features from fully simulated EDM cavities are used as separate instances. The performances of two ANN are evaluated, one trained without modification of process parameters (gap size and crater shape) and the second trained with a range of process parameter instances. It is shown that in both cases, the ANN can produce unseen tool shape geometries with less than 6% deviation compared to the full computational optimization process and at virtually no cost. Our results demonstrate that optimized tool shapes can be generated almost instantaneously, opening the door to the rapid virtual design and manufacturability assessment of μEDM die-sinking operations. © 2020 by ASME.},

abstract={An actual test of medium-duty truck collision with twin anti-ram bollards of steel tube is analysed and simulated with different mass-spring-damper models to study bollard design requirements. Test data is obtained from test report of a medium-duty truck crashed into two fixed twin bollards at speed 78.3 km/h. Maximum impact load and impact height at that time is important in the analysis. Bollard height should be close to or larger than the vehicle’s centre of gravity height to avoid climbing of the truck on the bollard. However, increasing impact height yields also increase in failure risk of bollard. Foundation is also critical in success of the bollard in successfully stopping the vehicle. The bollard should be fixed to the frame embedded in the concrete foundation so that the deformation in concrete be minimised. The bollard should be so stiff to stop the vehicle while most of the impact energy is absorbed by the vehicle through deformation of its frontal sections. A single-degree freedom linear mass-spring-damper model is the simplest model, but its results are not in line with test data. Single-degree non-linear model simulates the peak load but not the load history. However, using engine mass instead of truck mass in the single-degree model provides acceptable impact force data for the bollard. Two-degree freedom mass-spring damper linear model seems to simulate both truck’s and bollard’s deformation in a good manner. Non-linear analysis simulates the collision in a more realistic way, but it requires more data to be determined with testing. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In order to analyze soft landing performance of typical legged lander with variable damping buffer, the dynamic simulation model of lander was established. Based on the simulation model, the soft landing performance of the lander in the uncertain landing environment was analyzed by using Monte Carlo method. The sample points were obtained by using dynamic simulation model and optimized Latin hypercube experiment design, and the incomplete three-order polynomial response surface surrogate models which reflects the complex relationship among the configuration parameters of landing gear, the landing environment parameters and the values reflecting the soft landing performance were established. In order to obtain the variable damping buffer with best performance, the buffer characteristic parameters of the variable damping buffer were optimized by combining the response surface model, Monte Carlo method and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm Ⅱ(NSGA-Ⅱ). The simulation model verification shows that the optimized soft landing performance of lander with variable damping buffer is enhanced. © 2018, Editorial Board of JBUAA. All right reserved.},

It is important to reduce the efforts required for the creation and maintenance of the simulation models. Especially for the simulation studies, less detailed models can be utilized where components could be omitted. We considered a simplification of the process flows through operation substitution for constant delays. Different levels of model complexity were investigated. For each level, different tool sets were determined which were substituted for delays. First In First Out and Critical Ratio dispatching rules were used. Lot cycle time distributions were utilized in order to compare simplified models with a detailed model. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Safety incidents are an expected part of construction; their occurrence leads to cost and schedule overruns, and sometimes severe worker injury. Incidents can be reduced through mitigation in the planning phase. To reduce safety incidents, proper quantification of risk impact is necessary throughout the project. Incorporating continuously occurring safety risks within a project network schedule represented by discrete activities remains challenging. This paper proposes a methodology for building a combined discrete-event continuous simulation model to predict safety-incident related schedule delays. An algorithm uses project information stored in a database to automatically construct a Critical Path Method (CPM) network in Simphony.NET. The model simulates daily risk occurrence using a discrete-event process to model reduced project productivity. An illustrative example is explained, and results are compared with a base case CPM network. Activities having a higher risk of incident occurrence are recorded to help practitioners develop proper mitigation strategies during project planning. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={To reduce the computational cost of high-fidelity simulations, model reduction techniques have been developed to approximate parametrized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) problems. Typically, a Galerkin projection is performed to obtain a reduced order model (ROM). In that case, the governing equations are projected onto the reduced basis space generated by applying a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) approach on snapshots of the full order simulation. The main issue of this method is its intrusiveness: the construction of the reduced matrices requires access to the full order matrices and thus knowledge of the solvers discretization and solution algorithm. Therefore, a non-intrusive reduced-order method for parametric CFD problems is proposed in this work, which is applicable regardless of the solver. This POD-based identification (PODI) method identifies reduced matrices of the same form as in the POD-Galerkin method using the least-squares technique. This identification uses the set of known time-dependent coefficients obtained by projecting all snapshots on the POD basis in the offline phase. Parameterization of the reduced system requires full order simulations for different parameter values. The resulting reduced system of equations is then solved online for a given set of parameters. The offline-online decomposition of the POD-Galerkin method is thus maintained. To demonstrate the proposed method, numerical results are presented for the convection-diffusion equation, using the finite volume method. The results are compared with the POD-Galerkin method and the benefits and limitations of the presented method are discussed. As the reduced basis is the same for the PODI method and the POD-Galerkin method, also the reduced matrices obtained through respectively identification and projection can be compared.

abstract={Organic solar cells (OSCs) made from PTB7:PC70BM, with different thicknesses of a conjugated electrolyte PFN (0, 5, 7, 10, and 15 nm) used as the cathode buffer layers, were fabricated partially in air. OSCs with 10 nm of PFN were the most efficient in experimental tests, at 7.41%. Numerical simulations of the cells were also performed using the physics-based Silvaco/ATLAS CAD simulator, which describe the OSCs using the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) model. Simulations were used to determine the optimum values of PFN thickness for achieving high overall performance, which lies in the region from 5 to 10 nm. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Metamodelling or surrogate modelling techniques are frequently used across the engineering disciplines in conjunction with expensive simulation models or physical experiments. With the proliferation of metamodeling techniques developed to provide enhanced performance for specific problems, and the wide availability of a diverse choice of tools in engineering software packages, the engineering task of selecting a robust metamodeling technique for practical problems is still a challenge. This research introduces a framework for describing the typology of engineering problems, in terms of dimensionality and complexity, and the modelling conditions, reflecting the noisiness of the signals and the affordability of sample sizes, and on this basis presents a systematic evaluation of the performance of frequently used metamodeling techniques. A set of metamodeling techniques, selected based on their reported use for engineering problems (i.e. Polynomial, Radial Basis Function, and Kriging), were systematically evaluated in terms of accuracy and robustness against a carefully assembled set of 18 test functions covering different types of problems, sampling conditions and noise conditions. A set of four real-world engineering case studies covering both computer simulation and physical experiments were also analysed as validation tests for the proposed guidelines. The main conclusions drawn from the study are that Kriging model with Matérn 5/2 correlation function performs consistently well across different problem types with smooth (i.e. not noisy) data, while Kriging model with Matérn 3/2 correlation function provides robust performance under noisy conditions, except for the very high noise conditions, where the Kriging model with nugget appears to provide better models. These results provide engineering practitioners with a guide for the choice of a metamodeling technique for problem types and modelling conditions represented in the study, whereas the evaluation framework and benchmarking problems set will be useful for researchers conducting similar studies. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Since complex simulation contains many factors and responses that interact in a nonlinear manner, it is important to use metamodeling for representing the causal relationships within the simulation models in a compact way. With the selected mathematical structure, the effectiveness of metamodeling depends on the comprehensiveness of the training data that is closely related to the size of the scenario space and available computing resources. Generally, sequential experimental design methods are more efficient than one-shot ones, but the later depend on the domain knowledge of the experimenters and are uneasy to be conducted automatically. This paper proposes a sequential neighbor exploratory experimental design (SNEED) method for metamodeling purpose. Through the peaks function example, we compare this new method to Latin hypercube with a support vector regression metamodel trained by their training data respectively. The result shows that under the same experiment sample count, the SNEED method produces better regression performance. ©2019 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

abstract={Simulation test evaluation of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cluster operational effectiveness requires the support of simulation models with different granularity levels such as precise, medium, and coarse levels. In order to ensure the confidence of the evaluation, difficulties in evaluating the effectiveness of different granularity simulation models of the UAV cluster need to be solved. Aiming at the problem that the existing evaluation methods are not fully applicable due to the constraints of a large number of actual flight data, this paper proposes the evaluation method of different granularity simulation models, completes the rationality analysis of the granularity partitioning of UAV cluster at three levels: precise, medium and coarse, and the rationality analysis of the support relationship between different granularity models. Based on the special input method, capability meta-models of the UAV cluster with different granularity are evaluated. The evaluation method of different granularity simulation models of the UAV cluster based on sensitivity analysis is proposed. The sensitivity factor extraction and simulation analysis of precise granularity in the motion layer, medium granularity in the perception layer, and coarse granularity in the decision layer are completed. The validity evaluation of the different granularity simulation models has laid a solid foundation for the simulation test evaluation of the UAV cluster operational effectiveness. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Good domain-modeling enables an appropriate separation of concerns that improves quality properties in the simulation models, such as modifiability and maintainability. In this paper, the interplay of abstraction and concreteness in advancing the theory and practice of Modelling and Simulation is improved using the Model-Driven Engineering levels for building simulation models devoted to routing processes. The definition of this type of processes is detailed as a domain-model conceived as an abstraction defined in a graph model. Such abstraction turns into a set of formal simulation models that are (later) translated into an executable implementation. The final simulation models are specified using Routed DEVS formalism. The methodological proposal is accomplished with the development of a Modelling and Simulation graphical software tool that uses the set of models (defined in terms of the Model-Driven Engineering approach) as the core of its operation. This graphical software tool is developed as a plug-in for Eclipse Integrated Development Environment with aims to take advantage of existent Modeling and Simulation software. Therefore, the usefulness of graphical modeling for supporting the development of the simulation models is empowered with a Model-Driven Engineering process. The main benefit obtained when the Model-Driven Engineering approach is used for modeling an abstraction of the final simulation model is a clear reduction of formalization and implementation times. © 2020 Karabuk University},

abstract={Piston diaphragm pumps are used worldwide to transport abrasive and aggressive slurries against high discharge pressures in the mining, mineral processing, and power industries. Intermittent suction and drainage of the diaphragm, however, can lead to pulsating output pressure, which has caused major problems in the application of these pumps. To improve the accuracy of simulations of piston diaphragm pumps and to enable better simulation of their pressure pulsation behavior, it is necessary to carry out a three-dimensional fluid–structure interaction simulation of the pump fluctuation characteristics. This article proposes a simplified simulation model based on the periodic motion characteristics of a piston diaphragm pump, where a ZMB240 piston diaphragm pump serves as the research object. By simplifying the numerical simulation of the model, we are able to analyze the deformation characteristics and the fluctuation characteristics of the piston diaphragm pump under different initial conditions for the pressure-stabilizing air chamber. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={This paper presents a reduced-order modelling method for grid-connected inverter (GCI) with long transmission cable (LTC). State-space models of GCI and LTC are first obtained from frequency characteristics of terminal impedance by applying vector fitting (VF) algorithm rather than conventional mathematical modelling. Then, Prony analysis (PA) and balanced truncation (BT) algorithms are employed to find an optimized order number of state-space model. Finally, a reduced-order model of GCI with LTC is established by removing non-dominant poles of original state-space model. Simulation results show that the proposed reduced-order modelling method is able to accurately obtain dominated poles of system, and reveal practical terminal impedance characteristics. The proposed method may simplify modelling procedure and improve computational efficiency for small signal stability analysis. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Modeling multiple simultaneous collisions is a complex task. While good approximations exist for collisions involving two bodies, when three or more bodies collide at the same time, the resultant system can no longer be represented using simplified models based on energy and momentum conservation laws. In this paper we exploit a general solution for the multiple collision problem based on the theory of elasticity. For achieving this goal, we exploit HYFLOW formalism support for representing dynamic topology models. In particular, incremental topologies can be defined in HYFLOW, and enable the description of an unbounded number of topologies without requiring their complete enumeration before simulation. In same systems, like the Newton cradle for example, the number of topologies is ∝ O(2N), where N is the number of balls, making it virtually impossible to employ traditional switching methods for a large N. ©2018 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

abstract={Population-based algorithms can become computationally intractable when applying in practical engineering design optimization involving computational expensive simulation. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an on-line variable-fidelity metamodel (VFM) assisted Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms (OLVFM-MOGA) approach. In OLVFM-MOGA, the VFM integrates information from low-fidelity (LF) and high-fidelity (HF) models is constructed to replace the simulation model during the optimization process to ease the computational burden. Besides, a novel model updating strategy is developed to address the issues of 1) which individuals will be sent for running simulations. 2) whether the LF model or the HF model should be selected to run for a selected individual. The effectiveness and merits of the proposed OLVFM-MOGA approach are demonstrated on the design optimization problem of a torque arm. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to further improve electromagnetic transients of modular multilevel converter in simulation, a fast energy equivalent model, simple and reliable, for converter-arm and sub-module is proposed. Specifically, the converter-arm is equivalent to a controlled source, ensuring that the converter has the same external characteristics and electrically decoupling the sub-module from the arm. This model simplifies sub-module switch and performs energy equivalence, using electrical independence features of the sub-modules. The proposed method also simplifies simulation circuit and reduces the number of nonlinear components in the circuit. The proposed simulation model is verified on PSCAD/EMTDC platform, showing that it is 1736 times faster than the detailed one. Results show effectiveness of the proposed fast energy equivalent model, guaranteeing high simulation accuracy and greatly improving simulation efficiency. © 2019, Power System Technology Press.

abstract={Model reduction techniques are often applied to improve the computational speed when finite volume models are used to describe the dynamics of heat exchangers (HXs) in vapor compression systems. One particular area of focus has been the simplification of the momentum equation, since it usually does not affect the thermal system behavior over the time scales of interest. This paper compares the effect of five reduced order variants of the momentum equation on the dynamics of complete vapor compression cycles. This comparison is achieved via the implementation of a dynamic model of an air-source heat pump, which enables the direct comparison of these different approximations on the system dynamics, prediction accuracy, and simulation speed on otherwise identical models. Simulations indicate that neglecting the phenomena on small time scales can greatly improve numerical efficiency with a minimal loss in prediction accuracy. The variants with frictional pressure drop only and with linear pressure distribution are also found to outperform other variants in both prediction accuracy and simulation speed. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

abstract={The dynamic equivalence of wind farms is widely used for model simplification. While, the accuracy will be lower without considering the influence of wind speed correlation caused by topography and wake effect. In order to improve the accuracy, this paper proposes a dynamic cluster equivalence method of coherent generators based on hierarchical clustering analysis. Firstly, it analyzes the impacts of equivalence's accuracy such as wind speed distribution, wake effect and control strategy of turbine. Then, it uses hierarchical clustering method to correlate the disturbed trajectory of rotor current of the intra-site turbines and obtains the dynamic clustering results. Finally, it uses power loss method to obtain the equivalent parameters of multi-machine equivalent model. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of this method. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Since complex simulation contains many factors and responses that interact in a nonlinear manner, it is important to use metamodeling for representing the causal relationships within the simulation models in a compact way. With the selected mathematical structure, the effectiveness of metamodeling depends on the comprehensiveness of the training data that is closely related to the size of the scenario space and available computing resources. Generally, sequential experimental design methods are more efficient than one-shot ones, but the later depend on the domain knowledge of the experimenters and are uneasy to be conducted automatically. This paper proposes a sequential neighbor exploratory experimental design (SNEED) method for metamodeling purpose. Through the peaks function example, we compare this new method to Latin hypercube with a support vector regression metamodel trained by their training data respectively. The result shows that under the same experiment sample count, the SNEED method produces better regression performance. © 2019 SCS.},

abstract={The widespread use of computer experiments for design optimization has made the issue of reducing computational cost, improving accuracy, removing the “curse of dimensionality” and avoiding expensive function approximation becoming even more important. Metamodeling also known as surrogate modeling, can approximate the actual simulation model allowing for much faster execution time thus becoming a useful method to mitigate these problems. There are two (2) well-known metamodeling techniques which is kriging and radial basis function (RBF) discussed in this paper based on widely used algorithm tool from previous work in modern engineering design of optimization. An integral part of metamodeling is in the method to sample new data from the actual simulation model. Sampling new data for metamodeling requires finding the location (or value) of one or more new data such that the accuracy of the metamodel can be increased as much as possible after the sampling process. This paper discussed the challenges of adaptive sampling in metamodel and proposed an ensemble non-homogeneous method for best model voting to obtain new sample points. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

abstract={Modeling and simulation are widely used in many business domains, such as logistics, manufacturing, warehouses, and hospitals. This research used discrete event simulation (DES) combined with agent-based simulation (ABS) to improve draftees' physical examination service by reducing their process waiting time. A computer simulation was developed to simulate a physical examination center that serves a person conscripted for military service. The waiting time before and after applying the proposed approach was compared. Data were sourced from the physical examination center admissions database and field observation. The computer simulation model was validated by comparing the simulation results with waiting time, throughput time, and doctors' utilization obtained in real operation. The experimental results showed that the combined DES and ABS model reduces waiting time by an average of 40.15% in waiting time by using the same resources. Thus, using the correct simulation model significantly reduces draftees waiting time in a physical examination center. The proposed approach can reduce waiting time in an examination center and can be applied to any physical examination process. © International Journal of Industrial Engineering.},

abstract={The leakage inductance of high-power high-frequency transformers is a key factor for bidirectional full-bridge DC/DC converters. The frequency dependent characteristic curve of leakage inductance in a wide frequency band is presented using analytical method, which can be divided into three regions and verified by comparing with finite element simulation. Also, the concept of turning frequency is proposed and the changing trend of turning frequency is studied for transformers with varying-thickness copper foils. Below the turning frequency, the simulation model simplification is implemented by replacing multi-layer copper foil with single-layer copper foil with the same thickness, which is verified by comparing the three-dimensional finite element calculation result with the measurement. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Sequential bifurcation (or SB) is an efficient and effective factor-screening method; i.e., SB quickly identifies the important factors (inputs) in experiments with simulation models that have very many factors—provided the SB assumptions are valid. The specific SB assumptions are: (i) a second-order polynomial is an adequate approximation (a valid metamodel) of the input/output function of the underlying simulation model; (ii) the directions (signs) of the first-order effects are known (so the first-order polynomial approximation is monotonic); (iii) so-called “heredity” applies; i.e., if a specific input has a “small” first-order effect, then this input has “small” second order effects. Moreover, SB assumes Gaussian simulation outputs if the simulation model is stochastic (random). A generalization of SB called “multiresponse SB” (or MSB) uses the same assumptions, but allows multiple types of simulation responses (outputs). In this article, we develop heuristic practical methods for testing whether these assumptions hold, and we evaluate these methods through Monte Carlo experiments and a case study (namely, a Chinese logistics network). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Due to the requirements of suspension layout space and vehicle performance, a damped continuously adjustable shock absorber with built-in solenoid valve was designed based on principle of pilot valve. The structure of the adjustable shock absorber and the formation principle of adjustable damping force were introducted. And then the working strokes of the adjustable shock absorber was modeled mathematically based on the theory of fluid mechanics and the abstract model of shock absorber working stroke. The simulation model was also established by Matlab/Simulink and different characteristics of the adjustable shock absorber at different currents were obtained. Combining with the national standard of the passive shock absorber, the experiment proposal of the novel damped continuously adjustable shock absorber was designed. At the same time, the adjustable shock absorber test was carried out on the INSTRON-8800.CNC hydraulic servo single-channel excitation platform. From the test results, it can be seen that the adjustment range of rebound damping force was 0~3.72.kN, the adjustment range of compression damping force was 0~1.01. kN. The error of the test and simulation results did not exceed 10% as the current was in the range of 0.2~1.4.A and it did not exceed 20% as the current was more than 1.4.A, which confirmed the accuracy of the damper model and feasibility of the damped continuously adjustable shock absorber. The relationships between the damping force and the currents were acquired which can provide data support for the matching development of its semi-active suspension controller and provide the reference for the design of the damped continuously adjustable shock.

abstract={As the complexity of composite laminates rises, the use of hybrid structures and multi-directional laminates, large operating temperature ranges, the process induced residual stresses become a significant factor in the design. In order to properly model the initial stress state of a structure, a solid understanding of the stress free temperature, the temperature at which the initial crosslinks are formed, as well as the contribution of cure shrinkage, must be measured. Many in industry have moved towards using complex cure kinetics models with the assistance of commercial software packages such as COMPRO. However, in this study a simplified residual stress model using the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch and change in temperature from the stress free temperature are used. The limits of this simplified model can only be adequately tested using an accurate measure of the stress free temperature. Only once that is determined can the validity of the simplified model be determined. Various methods were used in this study to test for the stress free temperature and their results are used to validate each method. Two approaches were taken, both involving either cobonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) or glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) to aluminum. The first method used a composite-aluminum plate which was allowed to warp due to the residual stress. The other involved producing a geometrical stable hybrid composite-aluminum cylinder which was then cut open to allow it to spring in. Both methods placed the specimens within an environmental chamber and tracked the residual stress induced deformation as the temperature was ramped beyond the stress free temperature. Both methods revealed a similar stress free temperature that could then be used in future cure modeling simulations. © 2019, The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.},

abstract={In view of the problem that the coupling between liquid sloshing in the tank and vehicle movement results in the low rolling stability and the proneness to rollover of liquid tank semi-trailer (LTST), an anti-rollover control strategy for LTST is proposed in this paper. An equivalent simple pendulum model is adopted to simulate the dynamic process of liquid sloshing in the tank, its parameters are identified, and a dynamic simulation model for LTST is established. Based on the 6 DOF linear simplified model for LTST, a LQR anti-rollover state feedback controller is designed and the additional yaw moment is generated by using differential braking. A simulation is conducted with the simulation model for LTST to compare the state responses under the step condition of the turning angle of steering wheel with and without control. The results show that the control strategy proposed can effectively prevent LTST from rollover. © 2019, Society of Automotive Engineers of China. All right reserved.},

abstract={Motivated due to boosting shares of renewable energy resources and the associated need for demand side flexibility, electrical driven refrigeration systems can specifically supply capacities through adequate use of cold-water energy storage. Therefore, a model predictive control approach is presented, mainly focusing on a simplified model to estimate the useable amount of the storage capacity. Aim of this investigation is to identify the influence of the uncertainties by this estimation. Using a simulation model of a cold-water refrigeration system a sensitivity analysis is performed. Based on synthetic incentive signals, various load shifting scenarios are represented and the feasibility of the suggested cooling supply schedules is evaluated. The examination of necessary schedule corrections by a basic plant control as well as the utilization of the incentive signals show a distinct dependence on the model accuracy. © 2019 International Institute of Refrigeration.

abstract={Based on the blasting engineering of the subway tunnel, the overall dynamic response of the 28-story frame-shear-wall structure is studied by field test and numerical analysis. Field test is the blasting vibration monitoring and operational mode analysis (OMA). OMA used Ibrahim Time Domain method to extract the modal frequencies, the modal damping ratio of the structure, provided the basis for further analysis of the vibration response laws. The structure is simplified into a mass-spring-damper model. Based on the modal parameters extracted from the AVT, fixed the stiffness matrix and the damping matrix of the mass-spring-damper model, and set up the dynamic differential equation. So the modal parameters and frequency-response-functions of the building bending vibration can be calculated. SIMULINK dynamic simulation model was established based on the dynamic differential equation of the mass-spring-damper model. Based on the blasting vibration velocity signal, the overall vibration response law of high-rise buildings under tunnel blasting seismic is analyzed. The following conclusions are drawn: 1. Under the blasting vibration of the subway tunnel, the vibration response velocity of high-rise buildings presents: vertical vibration is the largest, lengthways vibration velocity is the second, and transverse vibration velocity is the smallest. However, the vertical vibration velocity peak and tangential vibration velocity peak at the higher floors is not much different. 2. On the higher floors, the velocity peaks fluctuated with floor increasing, and fluctuation is interrelated with the dominant mode. The peak value of vibration velocities distribution shows this correlation; 3, To simplify the high-rise building to be the mass-spring-damper model and set up the mathematical model of dynamic reaction. Then, the Simulink simulation model was established for simulation calculation. This method can adequately predict the response of the structure under blasting vibration. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The objective of this paper is to propose an implementation framework of the quantification of margins and uncertainties (QMU) calculation for reliability and safety assessment of high-consequence systems in the presence of mixed (aleatory and epistemic) uncertainties. The aleatory and epistemic uncertainties are represented by a probability distribution and the Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence (DSTE), respectively. This study focuses on the need to alleviate the computational cost in terms of mixed uncertainties propagation, which is the core of the QMU process. The kriging model together with an adaptive sampling method is tailored to predict the responses of a system simulation model. The confidence factor (CF) for the QMU calculation is then evaluated by integrating the surrogate model and the DSTE analysis. The proposed approach is demonstrated by a numerical example to examine the computational efficiency. Finally, the proposed QMU framework is demonstrated via a simulation-based structural analysis of a pressure vessel with corrosion damage. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={An equivalent, i.e. A reduced-order model, of active distribution networks is derived, for use in (phasor-mode) dynamic simulations of large-disturbances. In the unreduced model, the network hosts a large number of inverter-based generators, responding to the disturbances in accordance with recent or near-future grid codes. The aggregated equivalent is of the 'grey-box' type and its parameters are tuned in the least-square sense to match the dynamic responses of the unreduced system to several training disturbances. Changes in operating point are easily reflected when initializing the reduced model. Simulations are reported on a detailed 75-bus distribution system. The accuracy of the equivalent has been checked with respect to untrained disturbances and changes of the operating point. © 2018 Power Systems Computation Conference.},

abstract={Modeling multiple simultaneous collisions is a complex task. While good approximations exist for collisions involving two bodies, when three or more bodies collide at the same time, the resultant system can no longer be represented using simplified models based on energy and momentum conservation laws. In this paper we exploit a general solution for the multiple collision problem based on the theory of elasticity. For achieving this goal, we exploit HYFLOW formalism support for representing dynamic topology models. In particular, incremental topologies can be defined in HYFLOW, and enable the description of an unbounded number of topologies without requiring their complete enumeration before simulation. In same systems, like the Newton cradle for example, the number of topologies is ∝ O(2N), where N is the number of balls, making it virtually impossible to employ traditional switching methods for a large N. © 2018 Society for Modeling & Simulation (SCS) International.},

abstract={Companies nowadays act in global production networks. These networks offer advantages such as production close to market as well as the exploitation of low factor costs. However, due to their interlinkage and complex structure, the resulting networks are characterized by a high susceptibility to disruptions. This paper presents an approach, which quantitatively examines the effects of disrupting events in production networks. The main focus of the study is on the question of how product quality is influenced by quality-related disruptions. To describe the analyzed relationships best, a Kriging based metamodel is adapted to the behavior of the developed multimethod simulation model. The results of the investigation are formalized causal relationships between the error probabilities in production networks, the inspection frequencies of the production systems involved, the respective generic network configurations and the observed PPM quality score. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={The Systems Modeling Language (SysML), which is the de-facto modeling standard in the systems engineering community, consists of a number of independently derived methodologies (i.e. state charts, activity diagrams etc.) which have been co-opted into a single modeling framework. This and the lack of an overarching meta-model that specifies relationships and rules governing the various language constructs precludes their uniform application across diagram types. This has resulted in a large unwieldy and at best semi-formal language specification, with adverse implications for interoperability of modeling tools and model execution. This paper presents an executable language that re-factors the SysML language schema and offers an equivalent textual syntax for model specification in tandem with the existing graphical syntax. This is aimed at supporting the development of time based simulation models useful for decision support and architecture verification and validation in systems engineering. © 2018 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a skin-based approach able to generate the variability model for a component in composite material due to its manufacturing process. It generates a skin-based model of the manufactured part. The skin model discretizes the part surfaces by points to take into account the geometric deviations, those points are the nodes of finite element analysis used for tolerance analysis of compliant assemblies. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a general and systematic simulation model for generating a variability meta-model for a component in composite material due to its manufacturing process. The model is constituted by three steps: definition and pre-processing of the nominal model, generation of the manufacturing process model and evaluation of the part variability. Findings: The advantage of this approach is related to the fact that it is designed as a part of a digital process that establishes a continuous and unambiguous flow of variation information from the part design to manufacturing and assembly and that takes into account the manufacturing signature. This is its uniqueness compared to other simulation approaches focused only on manufacturing. Research limitations/implications: Considering the variability around the nominal value of all the process parameters and parts with more complex geometries are not taken into account now, which will be modelled in practical applications. Practical implications: To properly manage uncertainty since conceptual design of complex product, next generation geometry assurance requires simulation models to realistically consider process signatures due to the manufacturing process. This work focusses on this next generation tool for geometry assurance. Originality/value: The literature is focused on metal sheets joined by welding or riveting. There are other materials widely used and typically compliant: the composite materials that typically used mechanical fixing elements (bolting, riveting) and structural adhesives to joint parts. No software tools exist in the literature to deal with uncertainty from manufacturing to assembly processes in products made by composite. This is the reason of the present work. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In the modern multicultural, globalizing, and simultaneously locally radicalizing world, evident limitations of understanding the cultural impact on even basic social capital processes open up a complex and challenging research frontier. Cultural policy experiments are time-consuming, too costly, and risky. Thus, there is a clear need to have feasible simulation models, which could help to foresee some consequences of social and cultural policies. However, there is a lack of available metrics, conceptual approaches, not to mention simulation models. In this paper, we present a scaled-down simulation of stylized cultural events' impact on social capital dynamics using NetLogo agent-based simulation model. The presented abstract model of social capital dynamics is based on well-known principles of Axelrod's model for culture dissemination, which we expanded for the agents' interaction not only in the physical space but also in the cultural features' space as well. Due to the added extensions, the presented simulation model is capable of simulating the impact of broadcasted cultural events. It is aimed to model not only neighborhood (pair-to-pair) interactions between simulated agents but also larger-scale social networking and mass media impact. Simulation results, among other things, reveal a plausible mechanism of culture impact to social capital, and cultural conditions for the emergence of various social cohesion states like globalization, polarization, or radicalization. © 2019 ACM.},

abstract={In the field of conservation biology, accurate population models are important for managing wildlife. It has been acknowledged that spatial structure should form an integral part of such models. Advancement in the power of desktop computers has allowed biologists to construct individual-based, spatially-explicit simulation models to predict the population dynamics of species. These models take into account local interactions and output emergent trends. However, whilst in many cases such models have been useful, for large landscapes, they may still be too computationally expensive. An alternative approach is to construct a metapopulation model. These are usually less computationally expensive, and whilst they often incorporate less detail than spatially-explicit models, they may still include enough spatial structure to be ecologically realistic. However, the assumption made in metapopulation models, that any individual within a patch can interact with any other individual of the patch may not always be appropriate. For example, in social species where the size of the social group home range is much smaller than the average patch size, individuals in a social group from one part of the patch may not interact with individuals from another social group in another part the patch. In such cases it is useful to consider spatial structure within the patch itself. In this paper we propose using the Shortest Path Voronoi Diagram (SPVD) to model the spatial structure within patches for social species. For such a diagram we use seeds to represent the centres of the social groups in each patch. We then assign each point of the patch to the seed it is closest to (where distance is measured with the shortest path metric). This partitions each patch containing seeds into regions. Together these regions form the SPVD. By linking the seeds of neighbouring Voronoi regions with shortest paths, a network among social groups is created. This can be used to model the dispersal paths of a population. Whilst analytic algorithms exist for the construction of the SPVD, these have often been developed for a polygonal domain. In complex landscapes, the time-complexity of such algorithms may become just as slow as grid-based approximations. Moreover, analytic methods may be less numerically robust and harder to extend to more complex variations of the Voronoi diagram. In this paper we offer a new grid-based approximation for the shortest path Voronoi diagram referred to as the quadtree-grid Voronoi Diagram (or q-grid VD). The construction procedure involves a decomposition of the landscape into a quadtree, and a propagation of circular wavefronts from each seed through a grid that is laid over the quadtree structure. We show how the q-grid VD can be applied to a wildlife population model using a squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) population in a semi-rural landscape as an example. By averaging outputs across multiple q-grid VDs we generate a time series of density maps. Such maps could be useful for informing wildlife management. © MODSIM 2009.All rights reserved.},

abstract={Conducting global sensitivity analysis using variance decomposition methods in complex simulation models with many input factors is usually unaffordable. An alternative is to first apply a screening method to reduce the number of input factors and then apply a variance decomposition method to the reduced model. However, usually selection of input factors is not done robustly and convergence of the screening method is not ensured. We propose two new criteria, a criterion that mimics the visual selection of the input factors and a convergence criterion. In the application of the criteria to a complex model, the Morris screening method has needed 200 trajectories to converge and the visual criterion has outperformed other existing criteria. Our proposal ensures a robust combination of the Morris and the Sobol methods that provides an objective and automatic method to select the most important input factors with a feasible computing load to achieve convergence. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={An electro-hydraulic actuation system with critically lapped servovalve and pressurized return line is exposited. The dynamic equations governing the behavior of various components are explained; using these nonlinear equations, a simulation model is developed in Simulink® software for the purpose of controller design and verification. Model requires very small integration step size as the equations involved are stiff. A relationship between the various pressures in the system is derived, and a simplified method for the nonlinear modeling of electro hydraulic actuating system is developed using these relationships. The simplified model is computationally efficient as the integration step-size is large compared to the original model. The computationally efficient model finds application in real-time hardware-in-loop simulation (HILS). © 2018},

abstract={This paper deals with the development of an on-line identification method for deriving simplified dynamic models. The practical applicability of the derived algorithm has been tested on the Capstone C30 microturbine installed at the Polytechnic University of Bari, Italy. For this purpose, a second order model has been identified by adopting the sensitivity theory involving the Lyapunov function giving rise to stable solutions in the on-line environment, renewing model parameters at every changes occurring on the physical system. This characteristic can be fruitfully adopted for implementing actual models in time domain simulators, giving rise to accurate results even if some internal parameters change. In order to investigate on the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in deriving a simplified dynamic model, several simulations and experimental tests were conducted in the Prince Lab of the Polytechnic University of Bari. The good agreement between simulations and laboratory tests confirm the validity and the applicability of the proposed methodology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Microscopic traffic simulation is an ideal tool for investigating the network level impacts of eco-driving in different networks and traffic conditions, under varying penetration rates and driver compliance rates. The reliability of the traffic simulation results however rely on the accurate representation of the simulation of the driver support system and the response of the driver to the eco-driving advice, as well as on a realistic modelling and calibration of the driver's behaviour. The state-of-the-art microscopic traffic simulation models however exclude detailed modelling of the driver response to eco-driver support systems. This paper fills in this research gap by presenting a framework for extending state-of-the-art traffic simulation models with sub models for drivers' compliance to advice from an advisory eco-driving support systems. The developed simulation framework includes among others a model of driver's compliance with the advice given by the system, a gear shifting model and a simplified model for estimating vehicles maximum possible acceleration. Data from field operational tests with a full advisory eco-driving system developed within the ecoDriver project was used to calibrate the developed compliance models. A set of verification simulations used to illustrate the effect of the combination of the ecoDriver system and drivers' compliance to the advices are also presented. © 2019 Johan Olstam et al.},

abstract={The conventional engineering robustness optimization approach considering uncertainties is generally based on a probabilistic model. However, a probabilistic model faces obstacles when handling problems with epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents an evidence-theory-based robustness optimization (EBRO) model and a corresponding algorithm, which provide a potential computational tool for engineering problems with multi-source uncertainty. An EBRO model with the twin objectives of performance and robustness is formulated by introducing the performance threshold. After providing multiple target belief measures (Bel), the original model is transformed into a series of sub-problems, which are solved by the proposed iterative strategy driving the robustness analysis and the deterministic optimization alternately. The proposed method is applied to three problems of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), including a micro-force sensor, an image sensor, and a capacitive accelerometer. In the applications, finite element simulation models and surrogate models are both given. Numerical results show that the proposed method has good engineering practicality due to comprehensive performance in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and convergence. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={In this paper, a fully nonparametric Hidden Markov Model is proposed, where both the state dependent emission model and transition matrix are all nonparametric and depend on a covariate. By reducing modeling bias, the new model extends the applicability of both the semiparametric HMM with nonparametric emission model and nonhomogeneous HMM. A modified EM algorithm, which combines the kernel regression technique, is proposed for estimation. Model selection procedures are provided and a conditional bootstrap method is employed to assess the standard errors of the estimates. A generalized likelihood ratio test procedure is further proposed and the Wilk’s type of phenomenon is verified to hold for the proposed model. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate proposed procedure, and the proposed model is applied in analyzing the impact of economic on stock market. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Accurately predicting the reliability of a physical system under aleatory uncertainty requires a very large number of physical output testing. Alternatively, a simulation-based method can be used, but it would involve epistemic uncertainties due to imperfections in input distribution models, simulation models, and surrogate models, as well as a limited number of output testing due to cost. Thus, the estimated output distributions and their corresponding reliabilities would become uncertain. One way to treat epistemic uncertainty is to use a hierarchical Bayesian approach; however, this could result in an overly conservative reliability by integrating possible candidates of input distribution. In this paper, a new confidence-based reliability assessment method that reduces unnecessary conservativeness is developed. The epistemic uncertainty induced by a limited number of input data is treated by approximating an input distribution model using a bootstrap method. Two engineering examples and one mathematical example are used to demonstrate that the proposed method (1) provides less conservative reliability than the hierarchical Bayesian analysis, yet (2) predicts the reliability of a physical system that satisfies the user-specified target confidence level, and (3) shows convergence behavior of reliability estimation as numbers of input and output test data increase. © 2019 by ASME.},

abstract={This study proposed an analytical method based on the Three Dimensional Rigid Body Spring Model (3D-RBSM) to realistically simulate bond behavior of deformed rebar in concrete. In this method, concrete was modeled by rigid particles using a voronoi mesh with random geometry and rebar was modeled by beam element connected to concrete through a link element that was assigned a suitable local bond model. The proposed model enables to evaluate changes in internal cracking and stress distribution due to variation in cover thickness and rebar diameter. Furthermore, it can simulate the bond stress slip behavior and transition of failure modes. Based on analytical results, it was confirmed that the proposed simplified model can evaluate bond behavior like three dimensional rebar model with rib shape, consequently, it provides an economical and efficient alternative due to lesser computational elements. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The power loop stray inductances of the silicon carbide (SiC) half-bridge power module (HBPM) must be included in the circuit simulation model to predict the power device switching characteristics and the power bus noise caused by the power converter. Instead of a full equivalent circuit model of the SiC HBPM, a simplified but accurate three-terminal equivalent circuit model is presented in this article. Based on the simplified model, a novel frequency-domain impedance measurement method based on the two-port network technique is proposed to extract the power loop inductances through direct measurement. By using the extracted power loop inductances of a 1.2-kV 300-A SiC HBPM, a three-terminal equivalent model of the HBPM is obtained, and its accuracy is validated by the finite element method and experiments. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In many practical applications of air-coupled ultrasonic inspection, the accurate direction of the wavefronts of the ultrasound in air is unknown. Thereby, the wave may reach the transducer at an oblique incidence angle. It may lead to misinterpretation of the waveform of the measured wave. This work investigated the quasi-dispersion of planar-wave signal affected by the receiving angle. An analytical model represented as a simplified model implementation was proposed to provide a theoretical prediction of the received signal. A numerical multiphysics model established by COMSOL Multiphysics® was used to demonstrate the signal reception by wavefield visualization. Simulational signals were in excellent agreement with the signals from analytical model. Finally, experiments with the similar configurations of transducers used in analytical and simulational models were conducted. The results confirmed that quasi-dispersion of the air-coupled ultrasonic signal which is highly dependent on incidence angle and wavelength. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGAs) are effective ways for obtaining Pareto solutions of multi-objective design optimization problems. However, the high computational cost of MOGAs limits their applications to practical engineering optimization problems involving computational expensive simulations. To address this issue, a novel variable-fidelity (VF) optimization approach for multi-objective design optimization is proposed, in which a VF metamodel is embedded in the computation process of MOGA to replace the expensive simulation model. The VF metamodel is updated in the optimization process of MOGA, considering the cost of simulation models with different fidelity and the influence of the VF metamodel uncertainty. A normalized distance constraint is introduced to avoid selecting clustered sample points. Four numerical examples and two engineering cases are used to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach can obtain Pareto solutions with good quality and outperforms the other four approaches considered here as references in terms of computational efficiency. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Recent developments in power electronics and renewable energy sources have brought the risen of Direct Current (DC) Microgrids. By power converters' utilization, a DC Microgrid is able to integrate renewables, storage systems, and other devices in a simpler topology, since the major part of the modern grid's compounds have DC nature. This paper proposes a control strategy aiming to regulate the voltage in the DC bus of a Microgrid by a supercapacitor. The control law is applied to a bidirectional boost converter that connects the supercapacitor to the DC grid. The control scheme is based on dynamical feedback linearization and consists in splitting the system in different time scale dynamics, creating consequently a simplified model. Simulations on Matlab/Simulink illustrate how the control strategy is able to regulate the DC voltage with good performance. © 2018 IEEE.},

In the first model, the frequency converter was fully simulated, in the second - an inverter and the synchronous motor were replaced by a current source. For research, two simulation models of a frequency converter with a three-level active rectifier, made according to a 12-pulse circuit, were developed and implemented in the Matlab-Simulink program. The harmonic composition of the consumed current and mains voltage at the connection point of the frequency converter is investigated. The conclusion is drawn about the possibility of simplified modeling of a frequency converter with an active rectifier analyzing the power quality in internal power supply systems of industrial enterprises. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={To improve the landing performance of a near-space manned capsule under various landing conditions, a novel landing system is designed that employs double chamber and single chamber dampers in the primary and auxiliary struts, respectively. A dynamic model of the landing system is established, and the damper parameters are determined by employing the design method. A single-leg drop test with different initial pitch angles is then conducted to compare and validate the simulation model. Based on the validated simulation model, seven critical landing conditions regarding nine crucial landing responses are found by combining the radial basis function (RBF) surrogate model and adaptive simulated annealing (ASA) optimization method. Subsequently, the adaptability of the landing system under critical landing conditions is analyzed. The results show that the simulation effectively results match the test results, which validates the accuracy of the dynamic model. In addition, all of the crucial responses under their corresponding critical landing conditions satisfy the design specifications, demonstrating the feasibility of the landing system. © 2018 IAA},

abstract={A trajectory of a destination-directed moving object (e.g. an aircraft from an origin airport to a destination airport) has three main components: an origin, a destination, and motion in between. We call such a trajectory that end up at the destination destination-directed trajectory (DDT). A class of conditionally Markov (CM) sequences (called CML) has the following main components: a joint density of two endpoints and a Markov-like evolution law. A CML dynamic model can describe the evolution of a DDT but not of a guided object chasing a moving guide. The trajectory of a guided object is called a guided trajectory (GT). Inspired by a CML model, this paper proposes a model for a GT with a moving guide. The proposed model reduces to a CML model if the guide is not moving. We also study filtering and trajectory prediction based on the proposed model. Simulation results are presented. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Different research groups have recently tested scaled floating offshore wind turbines including blade pitch control. A test conducted by the University of Stuttgart (Germany), DTU (Denmark) and CENER (Spain) at the Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI) in 2016 successfully demonstrated a real-time blade pitch controller on the public 10MW TripleSpar semisubmersible concept at a scale of 1/60. In the presented work a reduced-order simulation model including control is compared against the model tests. The model has only five degrees of freedom and is formulated either in the time-domain or in the frequency-domain. In a first step the Morison drag coefficients are identified from decay tests as well as irregular wave cases. The identified drag coefficients depend clearly on the sea state, with the highest ones for the decay tests and small sea states. This is an important finding, for example for the design of a robust controller, which depends on the system damping. It is shown that the simplified model can well represent the dominant physical effects of the coupled system with a substantially reduced simulation time, compared to state-of-the-art models. © Copyright 2018 ASME.},

abstract={The Arctic ocean has been the focus of increasing activities in oil and gas, marine traffic and fisheries as the resources in the Arctic area becomes more attractive for exploitation. There have been several studies on the response of ships and structures in ice covered waters, mainly for oil and gas applications. This paper presents a scenario simulation model for fisheries, crab pot retrieval, in partially ice covered waters. Snow crab fisheries in the Barents Sea is an ongoing commercial activity where partial ice covers may drift over crab pots which need retrieval. This scenario is unique in the sense that the ship and ice can be expected to experience wave forcing in addition to the ice-structure interaction. The complexity of such scenarios favor simplified models and a coupled simulation model consisting of ship hydrodynamics, ice hydrodynamics, ice-ice and ice-ship interactions. A case vessel is presented together with a scenario simulation model which is used to assess the ice impact forces during operations and the amount of ice interaction which can be expected in the region where the pot string is retrieved from the ocean. © 2018 ASME.},

abstract={Large infrastructure projects involving the construction of tunnels in urban areas constitute complex, integrated and multi-disciplinary systems, which require building and construction information modelling as well as computational design assessment tools for decision making during all project phases and during their complete life cycle. Even if the underlying information needed for computational analysis is stored in an information model, the translation to computational models is still cumbersome and requires significant manual work for model generation and set-up as well as excessive computing resources and time. To address these shortcomings, this paper presents a systematic summary of concepts for integrated information modelling, numerical analysis and visualisation for urban mechanized tunnelling. Our first approach “BIM-to-FEM” is characterised by a fully automated link for error-free data exchange between a standalone Tunnelling Information Model and the process-oriented simulation model for mechanized tunnelling “ekate”. In the second approach “SATBIM”, a fully automated data exchange workflow is established between a parametric multi-level information model for tunnelling and multi-level numerical models based on both Finite Element and Isogeometric Analysis, where meta models are employed for real-time design assessment. We discuss the different applications of these concepts, such as scenario-based exploration of design alternatives, real-time design assessment within a TIM based on meta-models, and the potentials of using these models for the process control during construction. Furthermore, we present two case studies where real project data has been used for the integration of information and numerical modelling. The examples in this paper indicate clear advantages of this approach compared to traditional approaches in terms of efficiency of modelling achieved by reduced user interactions and error-free information exchange, and show the benefits of multi-level model representation and real-time analysis tasks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A lander in the soft landing mode of shutdown at touchdown is taken as the research object, and the dynamic simulation model of its soft landing process is established. Based on the simulation model, the parameters of the worst landing conditions are obtained by combining optimization method and multi-island genetic algorithm (MIGA). The radial basis function (RBF) neural network is used to establish a surrogate model which reflects the mapping relationship between the lander's velocity parameter and the value of stability indicator. The sample points are obtained by discretizing the velocity parameters of the lander, and the soft landing stability performance of each sample point are calculated by using the neural network model. Based on the calculation results, the contour and the three-dimensional velocity stability boundary of each soft landing stability indicator are given, and then a comprehensive stability boundary of lander velocity is obtained. The analysis results can intuitively determine the range of velocity for safe landing, which provides reference for the rational control of lander velocity. © 2019, Editorial Board of JBUAA.

abstract={Microscopic traffic simulation is associated with substantial runtimes, limiting the feasibility of large-scale evaluation of traffic scenarios. Even though today heterogeneous hardware comprised of CPUs, graphics processing units (GPUs) and fused CPU-GPU devices is inexpensive and widely available, common traffic simulators still rely purely on CPU-based execution, leaving substantial acceleration potentials untapped. A number of existing works have considered the execution of traffic simulations on accelerators, but have relied on simplified models of road networks and driver behaviour tailored to the given hardware platform. Thus, the existing approaches cannot directly benefit from the vast body of research on the validity of common traffic simulation models. In this paper, we explore the performance gains achievable through the use of heterogeneous hardware when relying on typical traffic simulation models used in CPU-based simulators. We propose a partial offloading approach that relies either on a dedicated GPU or a fused CPU-GPU device. Further, we present a traffic simulation running fully on a manycore GPU and discuss the challenges of this approach. Our results show that a CPU-based parallelisation closely approaches the results of partial offloading, while full offloading substantially outperforms the other approaches. We achieve a speedup of up to 28.7x over the sequential execution on a CPU. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Uncertainty Quantification is a rich field that has been successfully implemented in diverse areas such as structural engineering, climate modeling and medical sciences. However, it has not been recognized as a central question in multi-scale material simulation models. These are broadly defined as physics-based predictive models used to calculate material properties/behavior using information from different time and length scales. They are recently receiving much research interest, especially with the advent of emerging concepts such as Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME). Like most computer simulation models, multi-scale material models have multiple sources of uncertainty associated with them. Uncertainty quantification is primarily focused on characterizing and reducing these uncertainties in order to enable their use in practical applications such as advanced manufacturing and engineering design. We present a Bayesian methodology for uncertainty quantification of a physics-based material simulation model used for predicting the precipitation of Nickel in advanced Shape Memory Alloys (SMA). The methodology uses a synthesis of real-world experimental observations and computer simulation data to quantify the uncertainty of input model parameters using Bayesian techniques. We then demonstrate the applicability of the calibrated model in the additive manufacturing of shape memory alloys. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

abstract={In spite of the wide improvement in computer simulation packages, analyzing, and optimizing the simulation model, particularly under uncertainty can still be computationally expensive and time-consuming. This paper aims to tackle these features by proposing a comprehensive methodology applied to black-box stochastic simulation models under uncertainty. For this purpose, the common surrogate model as Kriging metamodel is served to fit the simulation input-output data produced by Latin hypercube sampling experimental design. Taguchi terminology of robust design enables the optimization methods to control uncertainty and uncontrollable environmental factors. So as to formulate robust counterpart optimization, three different models in the class of dual-response surface are integrated with metamodel and robust design. Leave-one-out cross-validation is applied to validate the Kriging metamodel. Finally, a numerical case study as a direct speed control of dc motor under uncertainty is served to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method in real engineering problems. This simplified and practical mechatronics case illustrates how the proposed procedure can be expanded for analyzing and optimizing the real complex systems. © 1965-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Simulation-based methods can be used for accurate uncertainty quantification and prediction of the reliability of a physical system under the following assumptions: (1) accurate input distribution models and (2) accurate simulation models (including accurate surrogate models if utilized). However, in practical engineering applications, often only limited numbers of input test data are available for modeling input distribution models. Thus, estimated input distribution models are uncertain. In addition, the simulation model could be biased due to assumptions and idealizations used in the modeling process. Furthermore, only a limited number of physical output test data is available in the practical engineering applications. As a result, target output distributions, against which the simulation model can be validated, are uncertain and the corresponding reliabilities become uncertain as well. To assess the conservative reliability of the product properly under the uncertainties due to limited numbers of both input and output test data and a biased simulation model, a confidence-based reliability assessment method is developed in this paper. In the developed method, a hierarchical Bayesian model is formulated to obtain the uncertainty distribution of reliability. Then, we can specify a target confidence level. The reliability value at the target confidence level using the uncertainty distribution of reliability is the confidence-based reliability, which is the confidence-based estimation of the true reliability. It has been numerically demonstrated that the proposed method can predict the reliability of a physical system that satisfies the user-specified target confidence level, using limited numbers of input and output test data. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Simulation during the design and operation of microgrids should include dynamic phenomena that would be a result of the unpredictable variation in renewable generation and loading. Detailed modelling of different components is constrained when using simplified models from suppliers. Accurate prediction of system response is needed to maintain voltage stability within a microgrid during islanded conditions and when grid-connected, between interconnected microgrids. Distributed energy resources in a microgrid are constituted by local generation (mostly renewable and standby diesel), a grid connection and increasingly, local storage (most commonly batteries). Synchronised field data is used to validate, and improve, the results obtained from a microgrid simulation model during both steady-state and transient conditions. This microgrid simulation approach makes use of MATLAB™ and DIgSILENT™, and is shown to be useful in designing for predictable performance. With field representative results, the model developed in DIgSILENT™ can be used as a development tool allowing various control strategies and component configurations to be tested. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={This study solves the integration difficulty between scheduling and routing aspects of the multiple Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) problem through the winner determination problem (WDP). Our model reduces the cost of using multiple AGV for logistics and warehousing applications. We show that solving the WDP by the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is inefficient as the assignment of routes is made complicated by the combination of large number of AGVs. We illustrate an efficient approach through our proposed genetic algorithm using knowledge based operators, which decomposes a non-linear combinatorial auction model into a linear model. Simulation results showed the efficacy of MILP, the conventional GA and our proposed GA-based method. However, MILP only works well for small scale data. When the number of routes and AGV increases, the proposed GA method supersedes the other methods as indicated by cost and route flexibilities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The rapid increase in distributed generation (DG), especially commercial and household solar PV systems in distribution networks necessitates the development of tools that provide greater insights in the behaviour of large numbers of DGs. Simulation models do not accurately capture the response of DGs to grid disturbances, and analysis of a single inverter is not representative of the behaviour of other inverters. This paper presents the development and preliminary use of an aggregation tool that allows modeling of DG response to frequency disturbances based on experimental data across a distribution feeder. By altering different renewable energy (RE) penetration levels and/or composition of inverter models in a feeder the tool can model and observe a diverse range of responses to the same grid disturbance. The tool provides preliminary insight into whether a broader simplified model of DGs is possible in distribution networks and can assist network operators with managing systems with high renewable energy penetration. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The existing electromagnetic transient simulation algorithm can accurately reflect the operation characteristics of line commutated converter based high voltage direct current (LCC-HVDC) transmission systems, but the amount of computation is large. In order to improve the simulation efficiency of LCC-HVDC transmission systems, the existing electromagnetic transient simulation model of LCC-HVDC transmission systems is simplified, and the integrated electromagnetic transient simulation model and solution algorithm of LCC-HVDC transmission systems are proposed. The integrated model includes the converter transformers and the converter valves. The converter transformer adopts the simplified model and the converter valve adopts the ideal switch model, which can simplify the electrical network structure of the converter. In this algorithm, the electrical network topology of converters is divided into the main network and the sub-network. First, the main network is solved, and then the sub-network is solved according to the obtained results. Finally, the current and voltage of each converter valve in the current simulation step size are updated. The integrated electromagnetic transient simulation model and algorithm are programmed in the PSModel simulation software, and its efficiency and accuracy are verified by comparing with the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation results. © 2020 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.},

abstract={Coastal geomorphologists and engineers worldwide are increasingly facing the non-trivial challenge of visualising and communicating mesoscale modelling assumptions, uncertainties and outcomes to both coastal specialists and decision-makers. Visualisation of simulation outcomes is a non-trivial problem because the more abstract scientific visualisation techniques favoured by specialists for data exploration and hypothesis-testing are not always as successful at engaging decision-makers and planners. In this paper, we show how the risk of simulation model outcomes becoming disconnected from more realistic visualisations of model outcomes can be minimised by using the Coastal Modelling Environment (CoastalME). CoastalME is a modelling framework for coastal mesoscale morphological modelling that can achieve close linkages between the scientific model abstractions, in the form of lines, areas and volumes, and the 3D representation of topographic and bathymetric surfaces and shallow sub-surface sediment composition. We propose and illustrate through the study case of Happisburgh (eastern England, UK), a transparent methodology to merge the required variety of data types and formats into a 3D-thickness model that is used to initialise a simulation. We conclude by highlighting some of the barriers to the adoption of the methodology proposed. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={FPGA can be used to implement nanosecond step size simulation of Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC). However, the design of the solver limits its application in simulation realization. This paper presents an equivalent model simulation realization. Backward Euler method is used to discretize the bridge arm inductance and the sub-module capacitance. Thevenin's theorem is used to get the bridge arm equivalent circuit. The method take both the calculation accuracy and the simulation rate of the model into account and the design difficulty of the model solver is reduced. Model solution with the 100ns-step simulation is implemented in the FPGA. Comparing and analyzing the results between primary simulation and hybrid simulation of equivalent model from the effects and errors, two simulation waveforms are highly compatible and the paradigm error is within 0.5%. Moreover, FPGA-based Hardware-in-the-loop can simulate the complete operation process of the MMC switch, which confirms the effectiveness of the method. © 2018 IEEE.},

First, select the optimisation variables, optimisation objectives and constraints, define the variable range, and through the Opt-LHD to sample the optimisation variables. Then, obtain and fit the sample data, and take the sample data as the initial conditions into the established motorcycle traffic accident simulation model. Next, obtain the simulation data of the optimisation variables, and establish the response surface model of the optimisation objectives in MATLAB. Finally, using NSGA-II algorithm, the individuals in the population are solved based on the response surface model in turn, the Pareto solution set is obtained, and a group of satisfactory solutions is taken back to the simulation model for verification of the optimisation model, so as to prove the correctness of the satisfactory solution, and then the initial conditions of the collision between the motorcycle and the car are obtained. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In this paper new simple formulas for identification of the time constant T and time delay τ of the First Order Lag Plus time Delay model (FOLPD) will be presented. FOLPD model is very useful e.g. for PID controller self-tuning. Two cases will be considered. In the first case, the identified FOLPD model will approximate the dynamics of any unknown multi-inertial system. In the second case, the FOLPD model will be used for approximation of the second order inertial system with known time constants T1, T2. In both cases, the identification of desired FOLPD model will result from the best fitting of the system and FOLPD model step responses. This will be achieved by comparing of these characteristics in two specially selected points. Presented formulas for FOLPD parameters, in the first case, depend on these two selected points. In the second case FOLPD parameters will depend only on the known values of the second order system's time constants T1 and T2. © 2018 Proceedings of the IASTED International Conference on Modelling, Simulation and Identification, MSI 2018.

abstract={Model-based techniques are, these days, being embraced by the manufacturing industry in their development frameworks. While model-based approaches allow for offline verification and validation before physical commissioning, and have other advantages over existing methods, they do have their own challenges. Firstly, models are typically created manually and hence are prone to errors. Secondly, once a model is created, tested, and put into use on the factory floor, there is an added effort required to maintain and update it. This paper is a preliminary study of the feasibility of automatically obtaining formal models from virtual simulations. We apply the foundational algorithm from the active automata learning community to study the requirements and enhancements needed to be able to derive discrete event models from virtual simulations. An abstract model in the form of operations is learned by applying this algorithm on a simulation model composed of discrete operations. While a major bottleneck to be solved is the generation of counterexamples, the results seem promising to apply model learning in practice. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={To study the temperature distribution and change the law of the permanent magnet synchronous motors used in vehicles during extreme driving, the concept of extreme variable working condition (a running process from a low-power condition where a motor can run for a long time, to peak power and then to a low-power condition) was proposed. To calculate the temperature field, an overall simplified model of a motor was established, and the three-dimensional temperature field of the motor under some single working conditions was obtained by finite element simulation. Then, the accuracy of the simulation model and the calculation results were verified by a comparison with bench test data. Finally, a temperature field simulation calculation of the motor was carried under extreme variable working conditions, and the temperature rise characteristics of the motor under extreme working variable conditions were obtained. The results were obviously different from those of the normal working conditions. © 2020, The Korean Institute of Power Electronics.},

abstract={Support vector regression (SVR), as one of the most popular metamodels, has been widely used to replace expensive and time-consuming simulation models in complex engineering design process. In this essay, a global support vector regression metamodeling approach based on the sorted K-fold method (SKM-SVR) is proposed, which combines the K-fold cross-validation technique with SVR. Firstly, all sample points are sorted and divided into K groups according to their absolute prediction errors from traditional SVR metamodel. Secondly, K number of SVR metamodels are constructed based on cross-validation technique. The weighting factor of each SVR metamodel depends on their prediction accuracy. Finally, K number of SVR metamodels are integrated to form the SKM-SVR metamodel. The effectiveness of SKM-SVR method is demonstrated by a mathematical example and a pressure vessel design problem. Results indicate that SKM-SVR approach has better prediction ability than that of SVR. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Path planning optimization of mechatronic systems is a very important field of research that has been growing rapidly in recent years. Coordinate measuring machines (CMM), robotic arms, CNC machines, are often using a big amount of points to control the path planning. Within these efforts, some encouraging results are presented in this work on the optimization of path planning. By integrating ant colony techniques into genetic algorithm, path optimization can be reached up to 50% instead of the simple genetic algorithm. At the same time, the calculation of the optimal solution that makes this technique even more efficient is accelerated. From measurements made in a simulation model, reductions in overall trajectories were recorded up to 40% in cases where the number of points exceeded 500 while the optimal path planning time was reduced by up to 20%. In real-system implementation these values are slightly reduced due to the real-time execution of the movements. This integration makes the proposed technique particularly attractive in cases where are path planning between a large number of points and the calculation time is required to be small. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={With the popularity of sharing economy services, dockless bike-sharing systems have been one of the most economical and practical transportation tools in people’s daily life in China, making short-distance trips more convenient. Customers can see the location of all nearby bikes from their smart phones. They can unlock the electronic lock of a shared bike through scanning a QR code on the bike. One common problem that concerns both customers and operators in bike-sharing systems is the imbalanced distribution of bikes, happening most likely during rush hours. In this paper, we first investigate a theoretical question: Will unequal demands, given a sufficiently long time, eventually lead to zero bikes in some of the high demand places? We use a Markovian approach to show that this is indeed true. To extend the study, we build a generic discrete-event simulation model for the dockless bike-sharing system. Given all demand data and distance matrix, this model can be configured to represent most bike-sharing systems. In this short paper, we use this model to analyze the impact of different demands to a long-time bike distribution. © 2019 IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2019. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper presents a non-intrusive subdomain POD-TPWL (SD POD-TPWL) for reservoir history matching through integrating domain decomposition (DD), proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), radial basis function (RBF) interpolation, and the trajectory piecewise linearization (TPWL). It is an efficient approach for model reduction and linearization of general non-linear time-dependent dynamical systems without accessing to the legacy source code. In the subdomain POD-TPWL algorithm, firstly, a sequence of snapshots over the entire computational domain is saved and then partitioned into subdomains. From the local sequence of snapshots over each subdomain, a number of local basis vectors is formed using POD, and then the RBF interpolation is used to estimate the derivative matrices for each subdomain. Finally, those derivative matrices are substituted into a POD-TPWL algorithm to form a reduced-order linear model in each subdomain. This reduced-order linear model makes the implementation of the adjoint easy and results in an efficient adjoint-based parameter estimation procedure. Comparisons with the classic finite-difference-based history matching show that our proposed subdomain POD-TPWL approach is obtaining comparable results. The number of full-order model simulations required is roughly 2–3 times the number of uncertain parameters. Using different background parameter realizations, our approach efficiently generates an ensemble of calibrated models without additional full-order model simulations. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={In aircraft cabin door lock mechanism reliability analysis, a great number of calls to the time-consuming simulation models are required for accurate reliability assessment. In order to obtain an accurate reliability assessment with a few calls to simulation model of aircraft cabin door lock mechanism, an adaptive sequential sampling method based Kriging model is proposed in this paper. A new learning function is developed to select the most suitable training samples for updating experimental designs sequentially. All of the selected samples searched by a Genetic Algorithm can be ensured to reside far away from existing samples and reside as close to the reliability classification boundary of original performance function as possible. A stop criterion based on the principle of cross validation is developed to terminate the proposed adaptive sequential sampling algorithm, and it can ensure the accuracy of the constructed surrogate model to be used for reliability evaluation. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are verified by comparison with direct Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) for reliability assessment of the aircraft cabin door lock mechanism on locking position.

abstract={Model simulation is the mainstream method for low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability assessment of wind farms. To make sure the wind farm model simulated as the real-life system, the detailed model of target wind farm is needed. Meanwhile, in high density wind farm group, the transient performance of a wind farm could be influenced by neighbouring wind farms. The accuracy of LVRT simulation results is also related to the external wind farms if there are large interaction. It is necessary to investigate the interaction between wind farms in a wind farm group to find out whether the neighbouring wind farms should be considered and modelled as an aggregation model. The quantitative analysis method of interaction between wind farms during grid fault is proposed in this paper. The typical T-connection and radial connection topologies of wind farm groups are introduced. With the simplified mathematical model of wind farm group, key factors of transient interaction are derived. Additionally, the quantitative method of interaction is studied, and the influence coefficient is calculated through performance comparison between wind farms with and without interaction considered. The calculation results of a typical wind farm group demonstrate the effectiveness of the method proposed. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The presence of various uncertainty sources in metal-based additive manufacturing (AM) process prevents producing AM products with consistently high quality. Using electron beam melting (EBM) of Ti-6Al-4V as an example, this paper presents a data-driven framework for process parameters optimization using physics-informed computer simulation models. The goal is to identify a robust manufacturing condition that allows us to constantly obtain equiaxed materials microstructures under uncertainty. To overcome the computational challenge in the robust design optimization under uncertainty, a two-level data-driven surrogate model is constructed based on the simulation data of a validated high-fidelity multi-physics AM simulation model. The robust design result, indicating a combination of low preheating temperature, low beam power and intermediate scanning speed, was acquired enabling the repetitive production of equiaxed-structure products as demonstrated by physics-based simulations. Global sensitivity analysis at the optimal design point indicates that among the studied six noise factors, specific heat capacity and grain growth activation energy have largest impact on the microstructure variation.

abstract={This study develops optimal variable, lane group-based, speed limits for traffic control at freeway lane drop areas (e.g., work zones). The proposed approach adopts a simulation-optimization framework that utilizes a calibrated and validated macroscopic traffic flow model METANET, along with the microscopic traffic simulation model VISSIM, to develop the optimal speed limits. A multiobjective optimization framework is implemented whereby the model primarily seeks to improve traffic safety by reducing the average number of stops, while taking other objectives, such as the average travel time and throughput, into consideration. For optimization, the heuristic, biologically-inspired optimization technique known as particle swarm optimization (PSO), is utilized, and the ϵ-constraint method is adopted to allow for considering multiple objectives in the optimization process. The proposed traffic control strategy is then evaluated for a hypothetical freeway lane drop area under a real-world congested traffic scenario. The research findings show that the proposed lane group-based control strategy outperforms other link-based, variable speed limits reported in the literature. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Grid frequency deviation can be improved through short-term active power support from grid-connected doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) with inertia control. Based on the analysis of mathematical model and control strategy of DFIG, a simplified model of DFIG incorporating the inertia control is developed. Through the quantitative definition of equivalent inertia time constant, the ability of DFIGs to provide inertial response can be evaluated. By applying the slip control strategy in the vector control frame, this paper proposes a slip-feedback inertia control strategy which uses generator slip as a control variable. Finally, the simulation model is developed on DIgSILENT. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy can significantly reduce the frequency deviation caused by load fluctuation, with the advantage of accelerating the recovering speed and mitigating the adverse impact of speed recovery on grid frequency. © 2018 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.},

When performing empirical evaluation, however, the sheer size of open-access blockchain networks in their envisioned scale rules out the possibility of exact reproduction and validation in a lab environment. Rather, abstract working models - simulators - of proposed technologies need to be considered. To have value as research instruments, such simulators need to be widely validated for their accuracy by the research community, and also be highly transparent and reusable for allowing quick implementation and comparison of design ideas. We claim that established software engineering paradigms, namely model-driven development and software product lines can help address this need. We outline our own effort to develop a domain meta-model and object-oriented framework for efficient and reliable derivation of specialized blockchain network simulators. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Sensitivity and working bandwidth are two important features of cilium MEMS bionic vector hydrophone. However, in previous studies, they were mutually inhibited so that they could not be optimized simultaneously, which means that the method of increasing sensitivity would reduce the working bandwidth. This paper presents an efficient solution to this contradictive relationship. First of all, this paper makes a theoretical analysis of device structure through the two-degree of freedom mechanics system instead of previous single degree of freedom. Then, theoretical analysis, theoretical simplified model simulation analysis and actual model simulation analysis are performed by mathematical modeling and ANSYS 17.0 software. Moreover, four hydrophones of different cilium diameters are fabricated and comparison calibration test is performed. The results demonstrate that the sensitivity and working bandwidth can be increased simultaneously. Besides, their concave points of directivity curves are almost equal to each other. Finally, the sensitivity of the optimal structure can reach up to -185.9dB (1250 Hz 0 dB at 1 V μPa-1) and its working bandwidth is in the range of 20-1250 Hz which is the widest among all previous optimized structures. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={According to the characteristics of an actual electromagnetic rail launcher (EMRL), this article points out defects in the traditional dynamic response model of EMRL, proposes an improved dynamic response model, and analyzes its dynamic and stopping response characteristics. On this basis, it presents a fast and accurate numerical calculation method for three-dimensional transient electromagnetic (EM) force of the EMRL and an order-reduced model of EMRL dynamic response. Furthermore, the second development of commercial software leads to the establishment of an interior ballistic simulation model with EM-structural coupling. The model is used to analyze the interior ballistic characteristics of the EMRL under sequential discharge and continuous firing. The finding is that the dynamic response of the first launching rail will cause a deformation in the second launching rail, in which a greater fluctuation happens. When the time interval between successive launches reaches 1.0 s, the deformation of the second launching rail will no longer be affected by the dynamic response of the first launching rail. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Simulation is increasingly used as an engineering tool in the maritime industry. Currently, there is a particular focus on digital twins, where a supplier of equipment should also supply a simulation model of the equipment. Today, the person configuring the simulator must manually connect all required signals between these models, interpreting the meaning of each signal name to determine which signal can be connected together (e.g., connecting "pressure out" to "pressure in", while ensuring that their units match). This is a tedious and error-prone process. In this paper, we present a method for automatically connecting variables of different models while complying with the FMI standard in co-simulations. This also includes a method for unit conversions. The methods for both automatic connections and unit conversions are based on ontologies. The key idea is to build an ontology, based on existing ontologies, which enables structuring model input and output variables into groups and hierarchies, and assign them a defined type. This enables reasoning about connections between models, and simplifies the model connections. The focus in this paper is to present the ontology, how FMI interface signals can be connected to the ontology, and how this can be used to simplify model connections. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

abstract={In this paper, we propose a biped walking controller that optimized three push recovery strategies: the ankle, hip, and stepping strategies. We suggested formulations that related the effects of each strategy to the stability of walking based on the linear inverted pendulum with flywheel model. With these relations, we could set up an optimization problem that integrates all the strategies, including step time change. These strategies are not applied hierarchically, but applied according to each weighting factor. Various combinations of weighting factors can be used to determine how the robot should respond to an external push. The optimization problem derived here includes many nonlinear components, but it has been linearized though some assumptions and it can be applied to a robot in real time. Our method is designed to be robust to modeling errors or weak perturbations, by exploiting the advantages of the foot. Hence, it is very practical to apply this algorithm to a real robot. The effectiveness of the walking controller has been verified through abstracted model simulation, full dynamics simulation, and a practical robot experiments. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Reacting quickly to changing market demands and new variants by improving and adapting industrial systems is an important business advantage. Changes to systems are costly; especially when those systems are already in place. Resources invested should be targeted so that the results of the improvements are maximized. One method allowing this is the combination of discrete event simulation, aggregated models, multi-objective optimization, and data-mining shown in this article. A real-world optimization case study of an industrial problem is conducted resulting in lowering the storage levels, reducing lead time, and lowering batch sizes, showing the potential of optimizing on the factory level. Furthermore, a base for decision-support is presented, generating clusters from the optimization results. These clusters are then used as targets for a decision tree algorithm, creating rules for reaching different solutions for a decision-maker to choose from. Thereby allowing decisions to be driven by data, and not by intuition. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={A three-dimensional (3D) parallel process model simulating ironmaking blast furnaces (BFs) has been developed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). It explicitly describes the layered burden and cohesive zone (CZ), gas and liquid re-distribution near raceways, trickling liquid flow in the CZ and dripping zone, and stockline variation. The applicability of the model is confirmed by the reasonable agreement between predicted and measured in-furnace states and global performance under experimental and industrial conditions. Using this model, the 3D characteristics of in-furnace states for a 5000 m3 commercial BF with 40 tuyeres are revealed. Also, it is used to assess the commonly used slot, axisymmetric, sector and full 3D models, which may treat burden distribution as well as gas and liquid flows around raceways differently. The results reveal that the sector and full 3D models are nearly the same; the slot model over-predicts the coke rate up to 13 kg/tHM, and the axisymmetric model gives slightly higher productivity and liquid temperature. These differences are clarified by analyzing model simplifications and their impacts on in-furnace states. © 2019, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.},

abstract={Increasing environmental demands, alongside the planned penetration of natural gas as marine fuel, have rendered dual-fuel engines as an attractive prime mover alternative. In this context, knowing the specific fuel consumption is essential to selecting the most efficient engine. The specific fuel consumption can be approached by simulation models with varying levels of complexity that are either implemented by basic programming languages or simulated by dedicated packages. This study aims to develop a simplified model to predict the specific fuel consumption of dual-fuel two-stroke marine engines driving fixed or controllable pitch propellers. The model relies on clear trends approachable by polynomials that were revealed by normalizing specific fuel consumption. This model requires only the value of specific fuel consumption at a nominal maximum continuous rating to predict the engine consumption at any specified rating, including at partial engine load. The outcome of the study shows that the maximum deviations regarding the two simulated engines did not exceed -3.6%. In summary, the proposed model is a fast and effective tool for optimizing the selection of dual-fuel, two-stroke Diesel engines regarding fuel consumption. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={The large-scale, high-density integration of renewable generations significantly influence on the static\dynamic characteristics of power system, and bring challenges to system modeling, simulation, analysis and control. Aiming at solving stability analysis issue containing uncertainty, differential inclusion theory was introduced to establish a small-signal stability model in this paper. Based on the polytopic linear differential inclusion theory (PLDI), a power system under stochastic disturbances was described as variety elements of convex hull. Convex hull Lyapunov function (CHLF) was used to derive the stability criterion and construct strongly damping constraints for PLDI system. Subsequently, Hankel normal approximation was introduced to obtain the model reduction, and an optimization technique was built for stability analysis. The validity of the proposed method and criterion was tested under both simple two-machine system and New England system. The simulation results show that the proposed method can accurately reflect the intrinsic character of power system with stochastic disturbance. © 2019 Chin. Soc. for Elec. Eng.},

abstract={Agent-based models comprise interacting autonomous entities, and generate both individual and emergent system-level outputs. These models generally have a large set of free parameters, whose impact on output needs to be explored. Considering also the need for replication due to stochasticity, a proper analysis requires a very large set of simulation runs. Therefore, obtaining a simpler representation of a simulation model (e.g., metamodel) can prove useful. We primarily focus on the potential utilization of various metamodeling approaches, namely Decision Trees, Random Forests, kNearest Neighbor Regression, and Support Vector Regression in predicting the two different types of outputs of an agent-based model. Results show that system-level outputs are predicted with higher accuracy compared to individual-level outputs under equal sample sizes. Although there is no single metamodeling technique performing best in all cases, we observe that support vector regression is more robust to the increase in the dimension of the problem. © ECMS Lars Nolle, Alexandra Burger, Christoph Tholen, Jens Werner, Jens Wellhausen},

abstract={This study addresses the interactions between water users and water resources and describes the application of a Multi-agent simulation (MAS) model that has been developed to improve understanding of the processes that drive changes and variations in the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources in a semi-arid river basin. These processes include hydrological processes and water user responses to variations and changes in water availability. The results are relevant for climate change impact assessments, spatial planning and river basin management, in particular for water allocation in semi-arid environments. The MAS model represents water users that both respond to and modify the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources in a river basin. Farmers' decisions on irrigated area and crop type are simulated on the basis of rules including factors such as rainfall, anticipated water availability and observed water availability. Local water abstractions for irrigation influence natural water flows and, reversely, the distribution of water resources over space and time influences water abstractions. Model validity and the use of survey data for representing the studied system dynamics are discussed. It is concluded that a multi-agent simulation model offers a good opportunity for representing the interdependencies between water availability and water use in river basin areas where irrigated agriculture is an important water user. The model can be used for exploring the emergence of basin closure and its relation to water-scarcity patterns. This study shows that a decrease in rainfall and runoff in the Jaguaribe basin in the northeast of Brazil leads to a transition of water use from the dry to the wet season. The dry season water use decreases because of reduced water availability in the dry season. This is the result of reduced rainfall and runoff in the wet season and the consequent increased water use for irrigation in the wet season. A decrease in rainfall and runoff leads to a relative transition of water use from downstream to upstream at the basin scale. Strategic reservoir operation enables local water managers to offset the effect of decreasing rainfall and runoff with respect to water use at the sub-basin scale, at the cost of further decreasing water availability at the basin scale. © MODSIM 2009.All rights reserved.},

abstract={Insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) modules have become the most fragile component in electric vehicle drive systems due to the harsh operating environment. The failure of the relevant power module is mainly caused by temperature-related factors. To predict the chip junction temperature as accurately as possible, a compact thermal network model suitable for the thermal analysis of electric vehicles was proposed. The finite element model of IGBT modules containing a water-cooled system was built in ANSYS/ICEPAK firstly. Then a 3D compact thermal network model considering the thermal coupling of the upper and lower bridge arms was proposed and the steps of parameter extraction of the thermal network model were described in detail. Finally, the simulation results of the 3D thermal network model are in good agreement with the finite element simulation model. and experimental results shows that the proposed thermal network model can accurately predict the junction temperature of power module in electric vehicles. Compared with the finite element model, the proposed thermal network model reduces simulation time and is suitable for lifetime estimation and on-line junction temperature prediction for power module. © 2020 Chin.

abstract={The air pollution and global warming has become a major problem to the society. To counter this worldwide emission norms have become more stringent in recent times and shall continue to get further stringent in the next decade. From OEMs perspective with increased complexity, it has become a necessity to use simulation methods along with model based systems approach to deal with system level complexities and reduce model development time and cost to deal with the various regulatory requirements and customer needs. The simulation models must have good correlation with the actual test results and at the same time should be less complex, fast, and integrable with other vehicle function modelling. As the vehicle fuel economy is declared in cold start condition, the fuel economy simulation model of vehicle in cold start condition is required. The present paper describes a methodology to simulate the cold start fuel economy. The simulation methodology includes the engine heat balance equation, heat conduction through cylinder walls and heat convected by air. Based on the heat transferred and heat absorbed by the coolant, oil, block, the real time temperatures of engine oil, engine coolant and cylinder block are predicted. After the prediction of temperatures the engine friction as a function of oil and block temperature is predicted. The Idle speed is predicted as a function of coolant temperature and catalyst heating. The fuel consumption from hot start steady state condition will be corrected based the above (idle speed, engine friction) prediction. This methodology is used to simulate the cold start fuel economy. © 2019 SAE International. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Computational simulation models with different fidelities are usually available in the design of engineering products for obtaining the quantity of interest (QOI). To integrate and fully exploit variable fidelity information, a space mapping based variable-fidelity metamodeling (VFM) approach is developed in this work. Firstly, a Gaussian process (GP) model is constructed for the low-fidelity (LF) model. Secondly, a variable-fidelity metamodel is constructed by taking the predicted information from this GP model as a prior-knowledge of the QOI and directly mapped into the outputs space of the high-fidelity (HF) model. This space mapping process is performed by constructing another GP model. A mathematic example is first adopted for illustrating how the proposed approach works under different sample sizes and sample noises. Then, the proposed approach is applied to two real-life cases, modeling of the maximum stress for the structure of a Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull (SWATH) catamaran and predicting weld geometry in fiber laser keyhole welding, to illustrate its ability in support of complex engineering design. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents a compact equivalent circuit model (CECM) for a radio-frequency complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor transistor. The CECM includes an input/output ground-signal-ground pad model, metal interconnections, a MOSFET small-signal substrate model, and a pad coupling model. All the parameters of the entire test structure are extracted. Further, the calculated scattering parameters (S-parameters) and the experimental results are compared under multi-bias conditions. Excellent agreement between the model simulated and measured S-parameters is achieved up to 66 GHz. An error between the simulated and measured S-parameter is calculated under zero bias, and four active biases are within 0.0037 for S11, 0.0017 for S12, 0.006 for S21, and 0.0042 for S22, respectively. The same model is also investigated up to 220 GHz under zero bias and one active bias. The final results in terms of both magnitude and phase show that this model is very well suited for high-frequency applications. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The study is devoted to the development and research of new models and methods for the analysis and synthesis of the management of modern integrated facilities - production, retail, recycling, which are in active stochastic environment of suppliers, competitors, consumers. The analysis of analogues and prototypes revealed factors that guarantee the failure of new research and developments: - based only on Gaussian statistics, simplified models of object dynamics, search methods of large systems optimization. The classification of sources and generating mechanisms of the disturbances is carried out, models of nonlinear transformations of stochastic processes are presented. The paper presents the formulation and solution of problems of analyzing the influence of uncertainties and disturbances based on: - building of the resource simulation models of objects - virtual reality statistics generators; - using the optimal aggregation methodology to calculate the optimal operational and strategic management in the simulation model. The problems of obtaining probability distributions for non-linear transformations, in particular for the cost, output functions, are set and solved. Examples of the analysis of hyperbolic rank distributions and multimodal income probability distributions for the producer systems of a certain production segment are given. The development results made it possible to substantiate the conclusion about essentially non-Gaussian statistics of modern production systems and the recommendation about the need to study the statistics of optimal adaptive developing systems. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Energy-efficient motion control of hydraulic actuators is a challenging task. Throttle-free solutions have the potential for high efficiency. The main throttle-free approaches are pumpcontrolled systems, transformer-based solutions, and digital hydraulic solutions, such as switching transformers, multichamber cylinder and multi-pressure systems. This paper presents a novel solution based on a so-called digital hydraulic power management system (DHPMS). The DHPMS is freely rotating and a hydraulic accumulator is used for energy storage. In contrast to existing approaches, each actuator has its own DHPMS and a small accumulator to locally handle the power peaks. Only an average amount of power is needed from the hydraulic grid, radically reducing the size of the supply pump and the hydraulic piping and hosing. Pump flow is only 12.5% of the peak flow of the actuator in the case studied. Control of this type of system is challenging, and the model-based approach is used. The controller uses a simplified model and functionality is verified by using a detailed simulation model of the system. The results show that the approach is feasible but is demanding on the control valves. The system delay is also relatively long, which reduces the control performance in high-end systems.

abstract={Due to inherent variability (i.e., aleatory uncertainty) in material properties, loading conditions, manufacturing processes, etc., simulation output responses should follow certain distributions, which are the outcome of input distribution models and simulation models. Thus, uncertainty quantification (UQ) using simulation-based methods is accurate only if we have (1) accurate input distribution models and (2) an accurate simulation model. However, in practical engineering applications, only limited numbers of input test data are available for modeling input distributions. Moreover, the simulation model could be biased due to assumptions and idealizations in the modeling process. Thus, the simulation model needs to be validated to correctly predict the output response of the physical system. The statistical validation of the simulation model would require large numbers of physical test data, which is extremely expensive. This study presents a computational method to obtain a target output distribution, which is a good approximation of the true output distribution given limited test data and a biased model. Using Bayesian analysis, possible candidates of output distribution are obtained, and a target output distribution is selected at the posterior median. The target output distribution is used to measure the bias of the simulation models and the surrogate models for UQ and statistical model validation. Furthermore, the cumulative distribution function of the simulation model prediction error is presented to provide (1) the median of model prediction error and (2) model confidence at a user-specified error level. To demonstrate the proposed statistical model validation method, a simulation model of an offshore jacket structure panel is generated using ANSYS. This example has eight uncertain input parameters (six of them are geometrical parameters and two of them are material properties). For input distributions of geometrical parameters, the standard deviation of manufacturing tolerances is used, and three material tests are carried out to obtain input distributions of two material properties. The output response of interest is a reaction force. The simulation model is validated using three sets of material test data and experimental test data to determine model confidence on output prediction and the validity of the simulation model. The result of statistical model validation shows how much bias the simulation model has and how much confidence engineers can have in the model prediction at a user-specified error level. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The overall simulation of large-scale heat-transfer equipment is difficult due to the huge number of grids in the simulation model. To investigate the equipment's pressure distribution and heat-transfer characteristics under the rated load, in this study, we conducted a simulation of the flow field in the heat exchanger of a muffler using porous-media and dual-cell heat exchanger models. The results show that the heat-transfer and flow simulation problems can be solved using the proposed simplified model, while keeping the error between the simulated and experimental results within 5%. The overall pressure distribution of flue gas in the heat-exchanger section of the muffler was found to be uniform, with the pressure decreasing along the flow direction of the flue gas. The flue gas disturbance is greater in the inlet section and the pressure drop in the muffler section accounts for just 0.48% of the overall pressure drop. The simulation results of the muffler's heat exchanger obtained by this method can also serve as a reference for the optimization of the deflector structure. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of HEU.

abstract={Wirelessly powered implantable medical devices require efficient power transfer through biological tissue within safety constraints on energy absorption, often in the presence of environmental variability. Accurate modeling of the tissue medium is essential to evaluate the performance and sensitivity of transcutaneous powering systems. Here, we investigate loop and dipole antenna topologies in proximity to simulated tissue models and experimental phantoms, with emphasis on representing heterogeneous tissue with functionally equivalent simplified models, and modeling variability in tissue properties for sensitivity analyses. We first present a modified phantom formulation that provides greater control over frequency-dependent properties. We then show that homogeneous phantoms have limited use at representing input impedance and energy absorption at ultrahigh operating frequency by analyzing each antenna topology in proximity to layered or homogeneous tissue across frequency. We compare loop and dipole antenna topologies in terms of specific absorption rate and impedance, and show that frequency-dependent tissue behavior must be considered even at fixed operating frequencies. Finally, we discuss the dual utility of a transmitting antenna as a resonator to detect changes in tissue properties in addition to powering an implanted device. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The difficulty of unidirectional carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) machining is one of the main reasons for its limited application. Substantial studies have demonstrated that numerical simulation models can investigate material removal mechanisms from a microscopic perspective to solve machining difficulties. However, most published numerical simulations assumed that the friction coefficient was a constant value, which was true in simplified models, but not completely consistent with reality. To fill this gap, an amended friction model for calculating the tool-CFRP tangential contact was proposed for the numerical model of orthogonal cutting. Simultaneously, an experimental method for establishing friction model was provided, and a verification experiment to prove the correctness of the model was conducted. The results show the following: (i) in tool-CFRP tangential contact, the relationship between the normal force and friction coefficient is nonlinear, and the friction coefficient is not a constant value, (ii) the results of the numerical model with the amended friction model significantly improve in terms of predicted cutting and thrust forces, and chip formation compared with the conventional numerical model, and (iii) two zones of chip formation are discussed (i.e., splash state and accumulation). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The electric spring (ES) is a contemporary device that has emerged as a viable alternative for solving problems associated with voltage and power stability in distributed generation-based smart grids (SG). In order to study the integration of ESs into the electrical network, the steady-state simulation models have been developed as an essential tool. Typically, these models require an equivalent electrical circuit of the in-test networks, which implies adding restrictions for its implementation in simulation software. These restrictions generate simplified models, limiting their application to specific scenarios, which, in some cases, do not fully apply to the needs of modern power systems. Therefore, a robust steady-state model for the ES is proposed in this work to adequately represent the power exchange of multiples ESs in radial micro-grids (μ Gs) and renewable energy sources regardless of their physical location and without the need of additional restrictions. For solving and controlling the model simulation, a modified backward-forward sweep method (MBFSM) is implemented. In contrast, the voltage control determines the operating conditions of the ESs from the steady-state solution and the reference voltages established for each ES. The model and algorithms of the solution and the control are validated with dynamic simulations. For the quasi-stationary case with distributed renewable generation, the results show an improvement higher than 95% when the ESs are installed. On the other hand, the MBFSM reduces the number of iterations by 34% on average compared to the BFSM. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={The real-time simulation modelling of large-scale renewable energy base is the key for the dynamic stability analysis of renewable energy based power systems. In China, the Zhangbei renewable energy base has huge installed capacity of renewable energy, including wind power and photovoltaics (PV), which will be connected to the Beijing power grid through flexible high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system. In order to investigate the dynamic stability of the flexible HVDC transmission system with the Zhangbei renewable energy base, the real-time simulation model of the whole interconnected system is built based on real-time digital simulator (RTDS). There are more than 15 wind/PV power plants in Zhangbei renewable energy base. Due to the limited resources of RTDS, a simplified scheme for the Zhangbei large-scale renewable energy cluster is put forward in this paper, where the aggregated model based on the multiplier transformer is used for each wind/PV power plant and the topology of the renewable energy base is considered. Furthermore, several RTDS racks are interconnected via optical fibres to increase the maximum number of the computing nodes. Finally, the validity of the proposed modelling method is verified by both frequency-domain analysis and time-domain simulations, where the transient characteristics, such as low-voltage/high-voltage ride-through, are simulated and analysed. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

abstract={The presence of various uncertainty sources in metal-based additive manufacturing (AM) process prevents producing AM products with consistently high quality. Using electron beam melting (EBM) of Ti-6Al-4V as an example, this paper presents a data-driven framework for process parameters optimization using physics-informed computer simulation models. The goal is to identify a robust manufacturing condition that allows us to constantly obtain equiaxed materials microstructures under uncertainty. To overcome the computational challenge in the robust design optimization under uncertainty, a two-level data-driven surrogate model is constructed based on the simulation data of a validated high-fidelity multiphysics AM simulation model. The robust design result, indicating a combination of low preheating temperature, low beam power, and intermediate scanning speed, was acquired enabling the repetitive production of equiaxed structure products as demonstrated by physics-based simulations. Global sensitivity analysis at the optimal design point indicates that among the studied six noise factors, specific heat capacity and grain growth activation energy have the largest impact on the microstructure variation. Through this exemplar process optimization, the current study also demonstrates the promising potential of the presented approach in facilitating other complicate AM process optimizations, such as robust designs in terms of porosity control or direct mechanical property control. © 2019 by ASME.},

abstract={To acquire a reasonable model for structural dynamic strength analysis, a bottom-up finite element modeling and updating methodology based on multi responses is proposed. The fundamental principles of structural dynamics analysis and model updating were introduced, and the proposed strategy was applied to the case study of an L-shaped jointed structure. Components of the jointed structure were modeled sequentially, and inaccurate model parameters were updated based on the corresponding experimental modal results in the first stage. In the second stage, components were connected together by bolts. The joint interfaces were represented by thin-layer elements, and local joint parameters were updated based on strain frequency response function (FRF). Finally, the precision of finite element model (FEM) was validated by acceleration frequency response function. The results indicated that the proposed methodology is able to reduce model simulation errors in both components and the overall jointed structure. Not only can the updated model of a jointed structure reproduce the experimental results used in updating, but also predict responses that are not used in the process of model updating. © 2019, KSME & Springer.},

abstract={The natural frequencies and mode shapes of the flapwise and chordwise vibrations of a rotating cracked Euler-Bernoulli beam are investigated using a simplified method. This approach is based on obtaining the lateral deflection of the cracked rotating beam by subtracting the potential energy of a rotating massless spring, which represents the crack, from the total potential energy of the intact rotating beam. With this new method, it is assumed that the admissible function which satisfies the geometric boundary conditions of an intact beam is valid even in the presence of a crack. Furthermore, the centrifugal stiffness due to rotation is considered as an additional stiffness, which is obtained from the rotational speed and the geometry of the beam. Finally, the Rayleigh-Ritz method is utilised to solve the eigenvalue problem. The validity of the results is confirmed at different rotational speeds, crack depth and location by comparison with solid and beam finite element model simulations. Furthermore, the mode shapes are compared with those obtained from finite element models using a Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Aircraft power and propulsion system design is evolving towards more electric technology for the purpose of improving overall efficiency. This poses new challenges for modelling, simulation, optimal design of systems containing mechanical and electrical components, including many switching power electronic converters. The generalized gyrator theory and time-domain transfer function theory provide new tools for studying the dynamics and stability of such electromechanical systems. This paper presents these concepts to help with the analysis, design and control of the more electric aircraft. Using the generalized gyrator theory, the mechanical components can be transferred to the electrical side of the system and representedby their electrical models. The time-domain transfer function theory of power electronics provides a method to model switching power electronics converters as a generalized transformer. This allows for the referral of circuit elements from one side of the switching converter to the other. As a result, the complex aircraft electromechanical system can be reduced to an electrical circuit simplified model. This will assist in the detailed analysis, design and control of the system, prior to physical prototyping (iron-bird). In addition, the overall system circuit model will provide a better insight into the operation and interactions between the components of the system. Basic theory, example case studies, and future applications and benefits to the more electric aircraft will be presented and discussed. © 2018 AIAA.},

abstract={Efficient global optimisation (EGO) is a popular method that searches sequentially for the global optimum of a simulated system. EGO treats the simulation model as a black-box, and balances local and global searches. In deterministic simulation, classic EGO uses ordinary Kriging (OK), which is a special case of universal Kriging (UK). In our EGO variant we use intrinsic Kriging (IK), which does not need to estimate the parameters that quantify the trend in UK. In random simulation, classic EGO uses stochastic Kriging (SK), but we replace SK by stochastic IK (SIK). Moreover, in random simulation, EGO needs to select the number of replications per simulated input combination, accounting for the heteroscedastic variances of the simulation outputs. A popular method uses optimal computer budget allocation (OCBA), which allocates the available total number of replications to simulated combinations. We replace OCBA by a new allocation algorithm. We perform several numerical experiments with deterministic simulations and random simulations. These experiments suggest that (1) in deterministic simulations, EGO with IK outperforms classic EGO; (2) in random simulations, EGO with SIK and our allocation rule does not perform significantly better than EGO with SK and OCBA. © 2018, © Operational Research Society 2018.},

abstract={Population-based algorithms, which require a large number of fitness evaluations, can become computationally intractable when applied in engineering design optimization problems involving computational expensive simulations. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an on-line variable-fidelity metamodel assisted Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (OLVFM-MOGA) approach. In OLVFM-MOGA, the variable-fidelity metamodel (VFM) is constructed to replace the expensive simulation models to ease the computational burden. Besides, a novel model updating strategy is developed to address the issues of 1) which sample points should be sent for simulation analysis to improve the optimization quality, and 2) whether the low-fidelity (LF) model or the high-fidelity (HF) model should be selected to run for a selected sample point. Six numerical examples and an engineering case with different degrees of complexity are used to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach. Results illustrate that the proposed OLVFM-MOGA is able to obtain comparable convergence and diversity of the Pareto frontier as to that obtained by MOGA with HF model, while at the same time significantly reducing the computational cost. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The determination of the thermal-elastic behavior is one of the main aspects in the design phase of new machine frames. Prototypically simulation models are used for preliminary investigations, which are based on finite element approaches and usually work with simplified material laws. By the manufacturing of machine frames of concrete steel reinforcements are used to ensure the operation reliability due to the high sensitivity of concrete to tensile stresses. Because of different thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of steel and concrete the reinforcement has a not negligible influence on the total thermal behavior of the system, which cannot be covered with conventional material laws, e.g. from material libraries. Preliminary investigations show, that a volume fraction more than 1 % of the reinforcement of the total volume can cause a relative error up to ten percent in the temperature field. To reflect the real behavior of reinforced concrete for a machine bed, the influence should be exanimated for two different approaches. Next to the real illustration of the geometry of the reinforcement in the FE-model, decoupled simulation approaches are used on reduced models, which should approach numerically the material behavior of the reinforcement. © 2019, Editorial Institution of Wrocaw Board of Scientific.

abstract={Cabled undersea observation networks have been attracting increasing research attention due to the abilities of abundant power distribution and broad bandwidth communication. Stability of their power supply systems is crucial for their normal operation. However, rare studies were carried out on stability analysis of such multi-node undersea power supply systems. This paper focuses on analyzing the steady-state characteristics of multi-node tree topology power supply system for regional coastal ocean observation network. Firstly, the equivalent model of power delivery submarine cable is introduced, as well as the cable parameters calculating method. Then, based on features of the power network, simplified model of constant power load (CPL) and voltage algorithm of multi-node tree topology network are proposed and built respectively, to obtain each node voltage of a given network. The algorithm was carried out on MATLAB, and simulation model of the observatory network was set in Pspice based on CPL theory. Full-response time-domain method was proposed to analyze the dynamic process at scenarios of startup and load step change. Simulations and experiments were carried out, from which results showed good consistence, verifying the theoretical methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Transient analysis is an indispensable tool for analyzing the voltage fluctuation of distribution systems according to the penetration of distributed generations with grid-connected inverters. Electromagnetic transient (EMT) analysis is suitable for the purpose because it enables detailed modeling of the inverters and accurate simulation of their dynamic behavior. However, the EMT analysis requires a smaller calculation time step by a factor of 500 if the simulated power system includes the inverters. Simulation of the inverters is a bottleneck in speeding up the EMT analysis. This paper proposes a novel average-value modeling method for the grid-connected inverters. The proposed inverter model operates in a larger calculation time step, and speeds up the EMT analysis of distribution systems containing the inverters. The maximum error in the output power was 8% compared to the result by the conventional model. Dynamic voltage simulations are demonstrated with a test case, which includes tap changing transformers with a voltage controller and a photovoltaic generation facility. The proposed model reduces the required calculation time by a factor of 754 compared to the conventional model whereas there is no significant difference in the simulated result. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Simulation modeling (SM) is going to gain more interest due to the rise of Industry 4.0. Although, SM has been used extensively to analyze the behavior of complex manufacturing systems in a cost-efficient manner without disrupting the production process, it has many limitations that contradict with the industry 4.0 era. These limitations include; the large computational time, black-box characteristic, and not being able to directly run optimization analysis. Metamodeling combines the merits of SM and design of experiments by achieving optimal solutions at a limited computational time, and the ability to study complex systems with an explicit form and deterministic output. This paper proposes an architecture of a Decision Support System (DSS) based on a simulation metamodeling optimization approach to assist in making timely and informed decisions, using the emerging technologies of industry 4.0 and cyber-physical system concepts. The main modules and information flow path within the DSS are demonstrated in detail. To illustrate the applicability of the DSS, it has been implemented in a leading home appliance factory. The results indicate that this promising tool can easily be adopted in smart factories to aid in tactical and operational planning activities. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={In this paper, we present a new approach of high accuracy multi-parameter modeling using artificial neural network (ANN) for an ultra-wideband (UWB) printed monopole antenna. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the neural network for high-accuracy multi-parameter modeling, the electrical parameters of the antenna such as return loss and maximum gain have been predicted using some physical parameters such as widths and lengths of the slots or sleeves. The advantage conferred by the proposed method is that fast and intelligent modeling method is available at multi-parameter structures in contrast with conventional blind parametric sweep simulation, and so a lower memory and higher accuracy of the behavioral model is achieved. It can also be advantageous when the user is looking for system level, as the increased components amounts can help as a surrogate model. Simulated and predicted via model results are presented to validate the usefulness of the proposed method. © 2018 Institution of Engineering and Technology.All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={The paper focuses on the different driving strategies (driving cycles) for minimisation of the energy consumption of an ultra-energy-efficient electric vehicle developed by students for Shell Eco-marathon competition. The vehicle runs on hydrogen fuel and completes a set track with a 1420 m length and zero vertical deviation which is used for the 2019 European edition of the contest. A dynamic simulation model of the vehicle is developed taking into account vehicle resistance forces. A simplified model of the propulsion system is also described and used in the simulation. The propulsion system consists of a hydrogen fuel cell with a 1 kW rated power output, electric motors, electric converters, motor controllers and transmission. Furthermore, a strategy overview is proposed by which the vehicle complies with all necessary strategy limitations deriving from the competition rules. The various driving strategies, that comply with the competition average speed and differ from one another by the number of motors and transmission ratio, are simulated. The optimisation is done by changing the maximal and the minimal no-load speeds of the vehicle. A comparison of the energy usage is therefore conducted based on these strategies and the optimal one is chosen. In conclusion, additional driving strategies are proposed, in case more vehicle manoeuvrability or simpler driving style are desired during the race. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Due to the adverse effects of traffic noise on human hearing, blood pressure, and cardiovascular system, reducing traffic noise interference and realizing indoor natural ventilation have become the key technical problems of street-facing buildings. To effectively solve this problem, a new sound insulation ventilation device was designed, and a corresponoling sound insulation ventilation model as well as a calculation model of fresh air volume was established. According to the simplified model of sound insulation ventilation, a Simulink simulation model was constructed. Effects of ambient noise and frequency on the sound insulation performance of the device were analyzed through experiments. The ventilation experimental data were compared with the simulation results to verify the accuracy of the Simulink simulation model. Influence of ventilation volume and ventilation chamber volume on the ventilation effect of the device was studied by Simulink simulation model. Then an optimization scheme was put forward, and the ventilation effect of the optimized device was simulated. Experiment results show that the indoor noise of running device was approximately the same as that when the window was closed. The sound insulation effect of the device was more ideal for medium and high frequency ambient noise. The Simulink simulation model could reflect the ventilation effect well. When the ventilation chamber volume was matched with the economic ventilation volume, the economic efficiency was the best. By adopting the further optimized device, the fresh air volume of single bedroom could reach 35.16 m3/h and the CO2 volume fraction could be controlled within 1 030×10-6, which meets the requirements of indoor air quality. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of Harbin Institute of Technology.

abstract={Today’s world is a world of simulation. Now a days, every product is first designed in virtual domain and then tested for actual implementation. To be able to perform such accurate virtual domain analysis, an accurate mathematical model is needed to be designed in first place. Specifically, in the field of dynamic analysis, so as to continuously monitor the system, the requirement a high-fidelity simulation models in all industries is rising rapidly and this has now become an important part of modern simulation strategies. FEA simulation software’s nowadays could provide very accurate results but they cannot be used directly for dynamic simulations where the environment is continuously changing (input forces, random vibrations etc.). Therefore, this paper deals with design of a mathematical model of a beam to overcome the above stated issue. The technique so used is Model Order Reduction. This method develops an efficient reduced model by reducing the degrees of freedom and also preserving a characteristic behavior of the system. The methodology deals with extracting the mass, and stiffness matrices from FEA simulation software, reducing their size (order), building a second order system using reduced sizes of mass and stiffness, analyzing mode shapes vectors and nodes for input force applications, and generating a state space model of the system. © BEIESP.},

abstract={Knowing the energy demand at the scale of neighborhoods allows the conception of efficient energy administration systems that aid to reach sustainability in the built environment. When energy demand data is not available, simulation models can provide estimations and thus enable the analysis of a neighborhood. To simulate the space heating demand of a residential building stock, often an aggregation is carried out. Aggregation implies using one or a few representative models to replace a larger number of building models. This paper explores the effect of the aggregation method on model accuracy when applying a first-order building model for the space heating demand of an urban residential district. The results show that aggregation leads to inaccuracies when the district includes buildings with varying values for their properties: the errors reach 14% if the district is highly polarized and 8% for more diverse districts. Aggregating buildings with identical properties diminishes the error compared to a total aggregation − aggregating the building stock as a whole. Aggregation with respect to certain building properties yields better results than others, with window area fraction and U-value of opaque surfaces leading to the first and second lowest error values. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Parameter calibration for computationally expensive environmental models (e.g., hydrodynamic models) is challenging because of limits on computing budget and on human time for analysis and because the optimization problem can have multiple local minima and no available derivatives. We present a new general-purpose parallel surrogate global optimization method Parallel Optimization with Dynamic coordinate search using Surrogates (PODS) that reduces the number of model simulations as well as the human time needed for proper calibration of these multimodal problems without derivatives. PODS outperforms state-of-art parallel surrogate algorithms and a heuristic method, Parallel Differential Evolution (P-DE), on all eight well-known test problems. We further apply PODS to the parameter calibration of two expensive (5 h per simulation), three-dimensional hydrodynamic models with the assistant of High-Performance Computing (HPC). Results indicate that PODS outperforms the popularly used P-DE algorithm in speed (about twice faster) and accuracy with 24 parallel processors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In order to study the pressure comfort of women in the process of wearing a typical compression sports bra, a simulation model was established using the finite element method to simulate women wear a typical compression sports bra, and the contact analysis of the human chest and the sports bra during the wearing process, Obtain the dynamic pressure changes during the wearing of the sports bra. In order to obtain a more accurate pressure value, the human body model is simplified into four layers, namely skin layer, fat layer, muscle layer, and bone layer. The skin layer and sports bra model are obtained through the method of reverse modeling, and then through the deletion calculation Generate adipose layer, muscle layer, bone layer and breast structure. The simulation results show: The pressure distribution between the sports bra and the human body: The pressure value at the human breast is 0.67 Kpa-1.87 Kpa, the shoulder pressure is 1.87 Kpa-3.68 Kpa, and the pressure at the bending part is 1.13 Kpa-1.74 Kpa. The pressure of the back shoulder strap and the part that is in contact with the human body is relatively uniform, ranging from 0.54 Kpa-1.14 Kpa. The experimental data in the literature proves that the finite element model is effective and reasonable. © 2020 Textile Bioengineering and Informatics Society.},

abstract={The dynamics analysis of the rear suspension system of the Fiat Panda III with electric motors mounted in wheels is presented in the paper. The simplified model of this system modeled using the multibody system dynamics method and the MSC. Adams package is proposed. In order to validate the proposed numerical model, the road tests were carried out consisting on passing the vehicle without motors in wheels at constant speed through the obstacle. The vertical displacement of the center of the vehicle wheel was measured during the tests. During the validation, parameters of the wheel-to-road contact, stiffness coefficients of springs and shock absorber damping coefficients of the suspension of the simulation model were modified so that the numerical results were consistent with the experiment. Further, such a tuned model was used to simulate the motion of suspension with the motors mounted into the wheels. The obtained results were validated, obtaining the accepted compatibility. In the following, a series of calculations was carried out in order to analyze the influence of stiffness coefficients of springs and shock absorber damping coefficients on the dynamic response of the suspension. © 2018, Polish Academy of Sciences Branch Lublin.

abstract={Accurate power and performance models are needed to enable rapid, early system-level analysis and optimization. There is, however, a lack of fast yet fine-grain power models of hardware components at such high levels of abstraction. In this article, we present novel learning-based approaches for extending fast functional simulation models of accelerators and other hardware intellectual property components (IPs) with accurate cycle-, block-, and invocation-level power estimates. Our proposed power modeling approach is based on annotating functional hardware descriptions with capabilities that, depending on observability, allow capturing data-dependent resource, block, or input and output (I/O) activity without a significant loss in simulation speed. We further leverage advanced machine learning techniques to synthesize abstract power models using novel decomposition techniques that reduce model complexities and increase estimation accuracy. Results of applying our approach to various industrial-strength design examples show that our power models can predict cycle-, basic block-, and invocation-level power consumption to within 10%, 9%, and 3% of a commercial gate-level power estimation tool, respectively, all while running at several order of magnitude faster speeds of 1-10Mcycles/sec. Model training and synthesis takes less than 34 minutes in all cases, including up to 30 minutes for training data and trace generation using gate-level simulations. © 2018 ACM.},

abstract={In this work we have performed an extensive CFD simulation campaign with the purpose of studying particle transport and deposition in different catalytic systems and under different conditions. Two types of geometric models representing different porous media were created. The first is a number of random packings of spheres created via rigid body simulations: this approach was tested in previous studies and was proved to result in realistic packings, validated in their geometric features and fluid dynamic behaviour. The second is a regular arrangement of spheres, which was also successfully employed in previous works to study fine particles dispersion. Using these random packings, simulations of particle deposition have been performed at different operating conditions. In the first part we calculated values of particle deposition efficiency and compared our results with the classical filtration theory, highlighting the criticalities in the use of the simplified models upon which the theory is based. In the second part we have studied the effect of polydisperse particle populations: this is also missing in the classical filtration theory, which always considers the transport of particles with uniform diameter. Thus, we have performed population balance modelling simulations for particle deposition, employing the quadrature method of moments (QMOM): as an accompanying technical addition, a study on the accuracy of the application of EQMOM in these systems is offered. Even more clearly in this case, the results show that the description of polydisperse populations has a very noticeable effect on the macro-scale description, which would dramatically improve the understanding of particle transport and deposition in filtration and catalytic processes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Contributing up to 40~70% of total errors deteriorating the machining quality of machine tools, thermal errors need to be decreased. Building the accurate thermal simulation model of spindle system is the premise to study its thermal characteristics and further reduce its thermal errors. However, the accuracy of the thermal simulation model mainly rests with the accuracy of the boundary conditions since the mesh model is accurate enough. In overcoming the poor consistency between the thermal experiment and thermal simulation, thus obtaining the accurate thermal simulation model, the empirically calculated boundary conditions should be optimized, which is essentially an inverse problem. Treating the heat generation rates and the convective heat transfer coefficients as the optimization objects, and the simulation difference as the objective function, a dynamic metamodel assisted differential evolution (DMDE) method is adopted to efficiently search the optimal boundary conditions. The metamodel generated on the already executed data can prescreen out the most promising trial data to speed up the convergence of the differential evolution. And the scoring strategy is used to select the top high possible trial data to further accelerate the convergence. Results demonstrate that the optimal boundary conditions can be obtained using this method with maximum temperature simulation error reduced from 85.6 to 4.9% and thermal extension simulation error reduced from 60.9 to− 3.5%. Furthermore, the number of executions of thermal simulation analysis is reduced from 2000 needed by genetic algorithm or differential evolution to an average of 206 needed by the adopted method. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In a hybrid steam/latent heat storage concept as previously proposed, containers filled with phase change material (PCM) are installed at the shell surface of a Ruths steam storage (RSS) to increase storage capacity through retrofitting. The detailed knowledge of the thermophysical behavior of such a concept is crucial to exploit its full potential. For this purpose, a novel high-fidelity co-simulation model is developed in this work, implementing an efficient and accurate thermal coupling concept of a dynamic RSS model with detailed conduction/convection PCM cell models. It accounts for the significant influence of angular position and orientation of the PCM cells at the RSS shell surface as well as the filling level in the RSS. To reduce computational effort, the PCM cells are logically aggregated to PCM sectors with similar thermodynamic behavior using a new optimization method that minimizes the total error. Therefore, quantitative criteria to find an optimized PCM cell aggregation are formulated. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed reduced-complexity co-simulation is demonstrated in typical operation modes of the hybrid storage. In the simulation study, the error can be reduced from 4.5% to 0.5% by using the newly developed optimal aggregation criteria. The computation time can be shortened up to 73%, whereby equally accurate results can be achieved compared to a model with high resolution. The developed co-simulation model serves as a foundation for design optimization, model reduction, dynamic state-of-charge estimation, and ultimately enables model-based control. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In order to reduce the pollutant emissions from diesel engines, a DOC+SCR catalytic converter system was proposed. A three-dimensional numerical simulation model of the DOC+SCR catalytic converter was established by using computational fluid dynamics(CFD).The model includes evaporation and decomposition of urea aqueous solution, but ignores the catalytic reduction reaction on the catalyst surface. Based on the simplified model, a calculation method of NOx conversion efficiency was proposed. The numerical model and the NOx conversion efficiency calculation method were verified by test results. Through the numerical simulation of the model, the flow field distribution of the catalytic converter was obtained and several optimization scheme were put forward. The results show that after optimization, in certain conditions, the pressure drop of the catalytic converter system is reduced from 9.98, kPa to 8.60, kPa. Also, the pressure drop caused by the catalyst structure factor is decreased from 2.98, kPa to 1.60, kPa. In addition, the NH3 uniformity index of the SCR can be increased to 93.45%,. The conversion efficiency of NOx can reach up to 92.87%, in certain conditions. © 2019, Editorial Office of the Transaction of CSICE. All right reserved.},

abstract={Assessing sediment yield in Mahanadi basin using GIS and SWAT model Abstract Longest earthen dam in Asia i.e. Hirakud dam has been affected by sedimentation problem which affects reservoir storage capacities and different reservoir operations. The actual survey is fulfilled with the aim of developing a trust worthy hydrologic model simulating stream flow discharge and sediment concentration with least uncertainty among the parameters picked out for calibration so as to verify the effect of the scenarios on the special distribution of sediment yield. This study presents the hydrological modelling of the Basantpur sub-basin in Mahanadi basin located in the State Odisha in India, using SWAT with an interface of Arc View geographic information system software to predict sediment transport to the reservoir for improving its useful life. The study involves the analysis of sensitive parameters of the simulated data 4 years calibration and 4 years validation on daily basis to predict the discharge and sediment load. The analysis was carried out using statistical parameter. The results also show that the prediction of sediment yield is highly sensitive to the sizes of different sub- basin due to sensitivity of topographic factors used in the modified Universal Soil Loss Equation. Model calibration and Validation were performed on monthly time period basis. © 2018 Disaster Advances. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={In spite of the wide improvements in computer simulation packages, many complex simulation models, particularly under uncertainty, may be inefficient to run in terms of time, computation, and resources. To address such a challenge, integrating metamodels and robust design optimization has been applied. In the current paper, a systematic comparative study is implemented to evaluate the performance of three common metamodels, namely polynomial regression, kriging, and radial basis function. The required experiments are designed by different space-filling methods including the orthogonal array design and three forms of Latin hypercube sampling such as randomized, maximin, and correlation approaches. Although, the impact of sample size on the performance of metamodels in robust optimization results are investigated. All methods are analyzed using five two-dimensional test problems and one engineering problem while all of them are considered in two forms that are expensive (with a small sample size) and semi-expensive (with a large sample size). Uncertainty is assumed in all problems as a source of variability, so all test problems are conducted in the format of robust optimization in the class of dual response surface in order to estimate robust Pareto frontier. The performances of methods are studied in two terms of accuracy and robustness. Finally, the results of comparison, an applicable guideline is provided to aid the practitioners in selecting the appropriate combination of metamodels and sampling design methods for investigating set of robust optimal points (estimated Pareto frontier) in simulation–optimization problems under uncertainty. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Testing of proton exchange membrane fuel cell system is one of the most important issues due to the cost and security reasons in railway applications. To reduce the cost, it would be necessary to have a representative simulation model for this case. Having an accurate model of proton exchange membrane fuel cell system requires considering several auxiliary circuits. However, in industrial application, the accurate model of proton exchange membrane fuel cell system and corresponding information are not often provided by the designer. Moreover, the simplicity and representativity of model is required to be compatible with overall traction chain model. The model has to be suitable for system simulation and not design purpose. In this paper, a simplified model of PEMFC system is proposed using the experimental profile mission. The impact of all the environment system of proton exchange membrane fuel cell stack is estimated using the average of polarization curve on several operational points. The parameter identification process is applied, and the obtained parameters are then inserted on the overall system of fuel cell stack. The experimental data obtained through train is compared with the consecutive simulation results. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={In the field of machine tools, applicable solutions for monitoring process forces are becoming increasingly important. In addition to sensor-based approaches there are also methods which utilize the already available signals of the machine control. Usually, the motor currents and, when applicable, position values of the feed axes are considered. By applying reduced order models of the machine axes, non-process components are subtracted from the measured signals. However, these approaches are often utilizing simplified models or require additional a-priori knowledge, for example construction data or actual parameter values. The former in particular has a negative impact on the quality of the estimations. To overcome these disadvantages, this paper presents a novel observer structure based on the mechanical system transfer function of the feed axis. One main advantage is achieved by applying scalable and automatically generated models with focus on distinct frequency ranges. All necessary information is provided by a frequency response of the speed control plant, as it is typically obtained during the commissioning phase of electromechanical feed axes. By inverting the system transfer function and considering an additional disturbance transfer function, the quality of the estimation can be significantly improved compared to previous approaches.

abstract={This paper describes a project to investigate the feasibility of building agent-based social simulation models from a combination of textual data and limited observational notes. As an example, we have developed a proof-of-concept Java-based simulation of one notional day at a scientific conference, based on the MODSIM 2005 International Congress on Modelling and Simulation. Textual processing of the conference proceedings was used to build a common-interest network between authors, which in turn was used to drive agent processes for choosing paper presentations to attend and people with which to interact. Specifically, correlations between frequencies of word pairs was used to derive similarities between papers, and hence between authors. Diary notes taken during the MODSIM 2005 International Congress were also used in developing the simulation, which was written in the Java programming language. The conference simulation shows realistic emergent phenomena, such as increasing clustering of conversing participants during the course of the day. The use of textual data does not completely eliminate the need for observational data, and more extensive observational notes would have assisted in producing a more detailed simulation of MODSIM 2005. However, we have demonstrated that the analysis of textual data can be used to simplify model development. In developing more general organisational simulations, time lags in the production of streams of text documents can be used to estimate the delays inherent in organisational processes. As a preliminary investigation of this approach, which we intend to pursue in further work, we show how a time delay can be extracted from the simple text snippets contained in two Internet news feeds. © MODSIM 2009.All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper proposes a Kriging assisted covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (AK-CMA-ES) for optimization of mechatronics device structures. The objective of the proposed method is to design reliable structures with reduced computational cost of the multiphysics finite element simulation. The Finite element model intends to analyze the sequence of failure events in mechatronic devices. This numerical model is used to estimate the thermal cycles to failure. Subsequently, the AK-CMA-ES optimization process is performed in order to improve the performance of structural design of mechatronic systems and to find the best designs with safety and reasonable computational costs. The proposed method couple the kriging metamodel with the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). Kriging metamodel is used to replace the finite element simulation in order to overcome the computational cost of finite element model simulation. Kriging is used together with CMA-ES and sequentially updated and its quality is measured according to its ability in the ranking of the population through approximate ranking procedure (ARP). The application of this method in the optimization of mechatronic systems proves its efficiency and ability to improve the performance of mechatronic systems with avoiding the problem of tedious computation. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Hydrological models are a popular tool for simulating catchment processes in response to a rainfall event. The wide range of available models means that hydrologists are faced with the problem of determining which model is best applied to a catchment in any modeling exercise. An attractive alternative to selecting a single hydrological model is to combine the results from several models, thereby providing a model performance that is substantially better than any model alone. Methods based on Bayesian statistical techniques provide an ideal means to compare and combine competing models as they explicitly account for model uncertainty. Bayesian model averaging combines individual models by weighting model outputs proportional to their respective posterior probability of selection. However, the necessity of having fixed weights over the length of the simulation period means that the relative usefulness of different models at different times is not considered. In hydrological modeling, evidence exists of the catchment responding differently under different conditions so that relying on a rigid modeling structure can lead to significant inaccuracies and biases, particularly when used for prediction. This study combines the benefits of model aggregation and a dynamic model structure via a framework where each model is adopted at each time step with a different probability. The framework is known as a Hierarchical Mixture of Experts (HME, Figure 1). The HME framework consists of individual models (known as experts) which may have different structures and parameter values. These are grouped by mathematical functions (known as the gating function). The probabilistic nature of the HME framework means it is ideally specified using Bayesian inference. Bayesian methods incorporate uncertainty in our observed data and design parameter values, but to date little work has been done in assessing the impact of the model structure on model uncertainty. HME is a shift towards incorporating model structural uncertainty. Previous work has shown that an innovation of the HME framework is that it provides a way of assessing the mechanisms of our existing models to see which structures or parameter sets are preferred to describe hydrological processes under different conditions. However, the challenge still remains to apply the HME framework to catchments for predictive purposes. This problem lies in determining how to calculate which model should be selected depending on the state of the catchment. In the study, the HME framework is applied to a catchment in NSW using two parameterizations of a simple conceptual rainfall runoff model. We investigate the usefulness of different predictors and gating functions. More complex choices for the gating function involving nonlinear or nonparametric functional terms are illustrated. The study shows that given careful comparison of predictors and gating function, HME can be a useful predictive tool, giving an aggregated model simulation that is better than any individual model. © MODSIM 2005 - International Congress on Modelling and Simulation: Advances and Applications for Management and Decision Making, Proceedings.

abstract={Effective online modeling of papermaking wastewater treatment processes (WWTPs) is an important means to ensure wastewater recycling and harmless discharge. A composite model integrating variable importance in projection with dynamic Bayesian networks (VIP-DBN) is proposed to improve the modeling ability and reliability in WWTPs. First, a variable selection method is applied to simplify the network structure and reduce modeling costs. Then the augmented matrices technique is embedded into the Bayesian networks to cope with the dynamic characteristics, nonlinearity, and uncertainty simultaneously. The modeling performance of VIP-DBN is evaluated through two case studies, a simulated WWTP based on benchmark simulation model no. 1 (BSM1) and a real papermaking WWTPs, in which the VIP-DBN model shows better modeling performance than its rivals. Specifically, compared with partial least squares, artificial neural networks, and Bayesian networks, the determination coefficient value of VIP-DBN is increased by 34.36%, 20.55%, and 3.30%, respectively, for the prediction of effluent nitrate in BSM1. The VIP-DBN can be used to deal with complex WWTPs in industrial applications, which provides a better practical method for soft sensor modeling and a guarantee for the effective decision-making of wastewater treatment processes for papermaking enterprises. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) require a large investment in construction, equipment and energy. To ensure sufficient return on these investments, RAS operations must be managed meticulously. RAS managers must consider numerous factors related to the biological traits of the fish, logistics, seasonal market demand, and livestock management. RAS that specialize in ornamental fish are faced with particular challenges in that a given species of fish may actually yield several different “products,” distinguished, for example, by color, which can be sold at different sizes for different prices. RAS managers need to consider the market prices of different-sized fish in the light of their production costs (cost of food and space, dependent on time in the system). The current study aims to develop an optimization model for the operations management of RAS specializing in ornamental fish. The objective of the model is to maximize annual profit. The methods used include: a general simulation model, built in Arena 11.0®, that seeks to mimic the studied system; an optimization procedure based on response surface methodology (RSM), including design of simulation experiments, stepwise regression (in SPSS® 11.0), and a nonlinear objective function and constraints solved with MATLAB®. The method is demonstrated in a case study—a RAS on Kibbutz Hazorea, Israel, raising ornamental koi fish (Cyprinus carpio). © 2017},

abstract={Overcrowding at emergency departments in Hong Kong has been a critical issue for hospital managers recently. In this study, we focus on optimizing the medical staff configuration to alleviate overcrowding. According to the service requirements proposed by the Hong Kong government, 90% of urgent patients should receive treatment within 30 min. However, this condition is rarely satisfied in the practical situation. Therefore, we formulate the problem as minimizing the proportion of urgent patients that violate the service requirements while satisfying the service requirements of the other categories and cost constraints, thereby resulting in an optimization problem with a stochastic objective and several stochastic constraints. To solve this problem efficiently, we proposed a multi-fidelity simulation optimization framework containing a low- and a high-fidelity process. We utilize an evolutionary algorithm with violation-constrained handling assisted by a surrogate model as a low-fidelity process to shrink the solution space and generate an elite population. In the high-fidelity process, we exploit the optimal computing budget allocation method to identify the best solution in the elite population based on a data-driven simulation model. A case study is also discussed, and the results demonstrated that with a limited labor cost, there is a 52.05% reduction on average in the waiting time of urgent patients. Meanwhile, our proposed multi-fidelity simulation optimization framework proves to save 98.4% of the simulation time. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={With the development of both a simplified model for calculating the mode transition performance of the dual-flowpath combined inlet and the simulation model for high-Mach turbine engine under the windmilling condition,the dynamic performance simulation of full transition process from turbo mode to ram mode for a Mach 7 over-under Turbine-Based Combined-Cycle (TBCC) engine was conducted. Mode transition was divided into four typical sub-processes,including ramjet cool open,afterburner staged shutdown,turbine engine throttle down, and turbine engine cool down (windmilling close). A mode transition strategy was proposed based on the principle of smooth thrust variation. The simulation results show that: TBCC engine thrust transition mainly occurs in the sub-process from full augmentor to non-augmentor during mode transition; both the ramjet operating in the cool open condition and the turbine engine operating in the windmilling condition will deliver negative thrust,the maximum value of which will account for 5.3% and 13.7% of the total thrust after mode transition,respectively,during the early and later period of mode transition; when the turbine engine gets into the windmilling operation,mode transition work points are located at the low-speed and high-flow region of fan and compressor characteristics map,and the pressure ratio of fan and compressor varies to 1.0 along with the decrease of air mass flow,which is in good agreement with relevant experimental results. © 2018, Editorial Department of Journal of Propulsion Technology.

abstract={This work provides a new approach for modeling the electromagnets of the magnetic levitation (Maglev) vehicle Transrapid intending to effectively and efficiently represent the statics and the dynamics in a frequency range relevant for Maglev control design and for the use in mechatronic simulation models. It includes the effects of magnetic reluctances, fringing and leakage flux, magnetic saturation, and eddy currents. The modeling follows a systematic approach by setting up the equivalent magnetic and electric circuits, and coupling the equations using Ampère's circuital law and Faraday's law of induction resulting in a system of differential algebraic equations. It allows to study effects occurring in the magnet design process or different operating points, resulting, e.g., from aerodynamic uplift, for which an extended validity range is needed. Since the computational effort of such models is significant, additionally, a numerical procedure for model reduction is presented yielding a simplified version, which possesses a nearly identical input-output behavior and is usable for control design or in large vehicle models. The proposed approach can be applied to any levitation or guidance magnet of the vehicle and is shown exemplarily for a Transrapid's levitation magnet. The model is validated for the parameters of the latest Transrapid vehicle, called TR09, showing good correspondence with the measured static force-current-gap characteristics and the inductance. © 1965-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a differential game based method is adopted for the aircraft trajectory tracking task in the presence of wind. Under this differential game based approach the trajectory tracking task for a given reference is formulated as a game between the aircraft controls (first player) and wind (second player). This method is integrated in a realistic flight simulator model including a nonlinear plant, actuator as well as sensor models by means of a cascaded control architecture. The controller, responsible for the rotation and attitude control, is based on the method of Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI). This controller is extended by a trajectory loop which allows to track reference trajectories under the consideration of external disturbances (wind) using the differential game based approach. The illustrative examples provided in this paper consider a realistic aircraft trajectory for the approach phase which, besides departure, can be considered one of the most critical phases of flight. The approach trajectory is determined based on the solution of an appropriate optimal control problem using a reduced model of the flight simulator. It is shown that the proposed approach can effectively be used for tracking trajectories without a-priori knowledge regarding the wind field. © 20202020 for this paper by its authors.

abstract={In-cylinder pressure oscillations in internal combustion engines have been associated with increased heat losses and damages to the engine components. The links between the acoustic waves and the increased heat transfer (and potentially ensuing engine damages) have not yet been well understood. In this study, a high-fidelity large eddy simulation model incorporating an auto-ignition model is used to simulate the combustion process and the associated pressure oscillation at various engine operating conditions. The study serves to develop a better understanding of the acoustic waves in a combustion chamber and their effect on wall heat transfer. First, a simplified model of the pressure oscillations is proposed and shown to accurately characterize the pressure in the combustion chamber. Second, the simplified pressure model and acoustic theory are leveraged to develop a model of the in-cylinder gas velocities. Finally, a heat transfer model is presented that takes into consideration the pressure/velocity oscillations and the inherent acoustic properties of the trapped gas. The increase in heat transfer is shown to primarily stem from an increased heat transfer coefficient due to the velocity oscillations of the trapped gas. The results are consistent with previously observed experimental measurements of the heat flux in the presence of pressure oscillations. © IMechE 2020.},

abstract={This study addresses a network-wide signal timing optimization problem with environmental concerns by a bi-objective stochastic simulation-based optimization (BOSSO) method. In this method, the global samples evaluated by costly simulation are used to build a type of surrogate model named the regressing Kriging model, which are then employed to predict bi-objectives of untested samples or filter noises from the evaluated samples. An adaptive selector is incorporated to determine which samples in the local trust-region are evaluated by costly simulation and which ones by the built regressing Kriging model. This helps to balance computational costs and accuracies of three quadratic regression models, especially when the variable dimension is high. The non-interactive role of a decision maker is taken to generate more non-dominated solutions around the desired bi-objective point. In the field experiments, an urban road network with 15 signalized and five non-signalized intersections in Changsha, China, is modeled as the simulation scenario by VISSIM. Then, the traffic simulation model is firstly calibrated from two aspects by the BOSSO method, which can well reproduce the reality. After that, the network-wide bi-objective signal timing optimization problem is also solved by the BOSSO method. Numerical results show that compared with the real-field traffic states, the total delay and vehicular emissions are reduced by at most 16.90% and 32.22% respectively under the budged number of simulations. Balance analyses also show the existence of a competing relationship between bi-objectives. Finally, the BOSSO method is validated to outperform three other counterparts (NSGA-II, BOTR and BOEGO) from various aspects. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Degradation of the quality of groundwater due to saltwater intrusion is considered as a major constraint limiting the use of water resources in coastal areas. Groundwater salinity prediction models can be used as surrogate models in a linked simulation-optimization methodology needed for developing and solving computationally feasible sustainable coastal aquifer management models. The present study utilizes two machine learning algorithms, namely, Genetic Programming (GP) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models to approximate density dependent saltwater intrusion processes and predict salinity concentrations in an illustrative coastal aquifer system. Specifically, the GP and GPR models are trained and validated using pumping and resulting salinity concentration datasets obtained by solving a numerical 3D transient density dependent finite element based coastal aquifer flow and transport model. Prediction capabilities of the developed GP and GPR models are quantified using standard statistical parameters such as root mean squared error, coefficient of correlation and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient calculations. The results suggest that once trained and tested, both the GP and GPR models can be used to predict salinity concentration at selected monitoring locations in the modelled aquifer under variable groundwater pumping conditions. The performance evaluation results for the illustrative aquifer study area also show that the predictive capability of the GPR models are superior to those of the GP models. Therefore, GPR prediction models can be used as a substitute for the complex numerical simulation model in a linked simulation-optimization approach requiring numerous solutions of the simulation model to develop computationally feasible regional scale sustainable coastal aquifer management strategies. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The research on the influence factors and recognition of electrical fast transient burst (EFT/B) is of great significance to the accuracy of relay protection action in power system. For the phenomenon of malfunction caused by EFT/B in the transformer neutral point gap protection, this paper studies its impact on the transformer neutral point overvoltage. Based on the existing segmented arc model, a simplified model is proposed to reduce the difficulty of establishing the traditional simulation model. On the basis of the analysis of the field relationship of breaker, a new method is proposed to determine the alternating current (AC) arc. In order to study the circuit breaker breaking at different times, breaking of different short-circuit types, breaking at different speeds on the impact transformer neutral point over-voltage size, this paper establishes a circuit breaker model in MATLAB. The time-frequency characteristics and energy distribution characteristics of different transformer neutral point overvoltages caused by EFT/B, lightning and single-phase grounding respectively are generated by using wavelet decomposition. Further, a criterion is set up according to the high and low frequency energy ratio. The simulation results show that the criterion can distinguish the three kinds of overvoltages accurately. © 2019, Editorial Board of Journal of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

abstract={Hot stamping is one of the key technologies to produce lightweight components for the automotive industry. Numerical simulations are an important tool to design hot stamping tools. However, the hot stamping simulations are highly complex due to the deformation as well as heat transfer and phase transformation mechanisms taking place simultaneously. An accurate prediction of these mechanisms leads to high computational cost. Conventionally, an elastoplastic material model with temperature and strain rate dependence is used to describe the forming behavior, while austenite decomposition models are used to predict the kinetics of the phase transformation. The time spent on calculating the phase transformations can reach up to 40% of the total calculation time. To overcome these computational time issues, the current study introduces an alternative fast approach, to reduce the total calculation time of the hot stamping simulation during the die design stage. The simulation is sped up by replacing austenite decomposition models with surrogate models. A machine-learning (ML) model is used as a candidate for calculating the final phase fraction of hot-stamped parts. To train the model, various simulations models with varying degrees of deformation and cooling rates are set-up in the commercial FEM program LS-DYNA®. The ML model learns from the deformation histories and the final phase fractions to achieve the desired accuracy. For validation, the proposed approach is tested and compared with fully integrated phase transformations models. The final phase fraction and the total amount of floating operations are used as indicators to evaluate the performance of the fast approach. The results indicate that the ML model performs well in predicting the final phase fraction after hot-stamping and a significant reduction of the calculation time evaluated from the counting of floating operation FLOPS is reduced from 5713 to 12. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Ultra-high frequency (UHF) partial discharge (PD) measurements in power transformers are becoming popular because of the advantages of the method. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the basic understanding of the propagation of signals inside the transformer tank and the factors that influence the sensitivity of the measurement. Since the winding represents a major obstacle to the propagation of the UHF signals, it is necessary to study the effect of winding design on signal propagation. Previous research activities have studied these effects using simplified models, and it is essential to consider the complexity of propagation in a complete transformer tank. Additionally, the quality of UHF PD measurements depends, to a large extent, on the sensitivity of the UHF sensors. In this contribution, a simulation model consisting of a simple, grounded enclosure with multiple winding designs is used to study the propagation characteristics of UHF signals when an artificial PD source is placed inside the winding. After analysis of the results, the winding designs are incorporated in an existing and validated simulation model of a 420 kV power transformer and analyzed to observe the influence in a more complex structure. Two commonly used sensor designs are also used in the simulation model to receive the signals. In all cases, the propagation and signal characteristics are analyzed and compared to determine the influence of the winding and sensor design on the UHF signals. It is found that the level of detail of winding design has a significant impact on the propagation characteristics. However, the attenuation characteristics of the UHF signals received by the two sensor designs are similar, with the electric field distribution around the sensor being the key difference. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Assuring the safety of automated vehicles is essential for their timely introduction and acceptance by policymakers and the public. To assess their safe design and robust decision making in response to all possible scenarios, new methods that use a scenario-based testing approach are needed, as testing on public roads in normal traffic would require driving millions of kilometres. We make use of the scenario-based testing approach and propose a method to model simulated scenarios using Gaussian Process based models to predict untested scenario outcomes. This enables us to efficiently determine the performance boundary, where the safe and unsafe scenarios can be evidently distinguished from each other. We present an iterative method that optimises the parameter space of a logical scenario towards the most critical scenarios on this performance boundary. Additionally, we conduct a novel probabilistic sensitivity analysis by efficiently computing several variance-based sensitivity indices using the Gaussian Process models and evaluate the relative importance of the scenario input parameters on the scenario outcome. We critically evaluate and investigate the usefulness of the proposed Gaussian Process based approach as a very efficient surrogate model, which can model the logical scenarios effectively in the presence of uncertainty. The proposed approach is applied on an exemplary logical scenario and shows viability in finding concrete critical scenarios. The reported results, derived from the proposed approach, could pave the way to more efficient testing of automated vehicles and instruct further physical tests on the determined critical scenarios. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={An anaerobic digestion model was set up and applied to estimate desired methane production in the form of biogas as well as unwanted methane emissions associated with farm-scale digestion of manure. The generally accepted Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 was simplified assuming that hydrolysis is rate-limiting during anaerobic digestion of manure, mainly consisting of non-readily biodegradable compounds. Simulations were performed to demonstrate the effect of temperature and retention time on methane emissions resulting from long-term manure and digestate storage. Moreover, the overall carbon footprint of several manure management scenarios for Flemish dairy farms was assessed based on model simulations and literature data. The scenarios assessed, differed in the possible presence of a digester as well as in the manure collection and storage method. A reduction in methane emissions was achieved for lower manure storage temperatures (through external storage) and by decreasing the stored manure volume and thus the storage time before (controlled) anaerobic digestion. At the same time, feeding fresh manure induced an increased methane production in the digester. The lowest carbon footprint could be achieved on dairy farms with fresh manure collection by a manure scraper, followed by controlled digestion and storage of the digestate in a gas-tight tank, located outside. The controlled digestion must take place in a properly managed and correctly dimensioned reactor as high digester methane losses and low digester retention times increase the carbon footprint significantly. © 2019 IAgrE},

abstract={A simplified model is proposed to simulate the working process of hydroxyl ammonium nitrate-based monopropellant rocket engines. The porous medium model and volume-of-fluid model are used to solve for the internal flow field of a monopropellant engine containing a catalyst bed to emphasize the establishment of a propellant decomposition model. The decomposition process is assumed to be separable into mass transfer and quick energy release processes. The mass transfer process is described by a two-stage decomposition model that combines catalytic and thermal decompositions according to temperature. This paper explains how to implement the two-stage decomposition model by using a titration experiment and thermal decomposition data. A detailed example is provided involving the calculation of the steady-state flow field of a 150-N monopropellant rocket engine in FLUENT. The results obtained using only the catalytic decomposition model and the two-stage decomposition model were compared with those of hot-fire tests, and show that the two-stage decomposition model is accurate. The combustion chamber pressure obtained from two- and three-dimensional simulations for the flow field of the engine agreed with the results of hot-fire tests. The calculated external wall temperature of the lower catalyst bed was slightly higher than the measured temperature, whereas the external wall temperature of the upper catalyst bed was close to the measured values. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={To predict gear wear rapidly and accurately, a new wear numerical simulation model is established considering distributed load between double tooth meshing area based on Kriging method. The distributed pressure and meshing speed, which should be obtained before calculating wear depth, are obtained based on the Winkler surface model and gear meshing theory. The Load to determine distributed pressure is distributed dynamically considering the effect of clearance caused by wear. Based on Archard's wear model, the calculation wear model of spur gear is derived, and the wear depth of each meshing points on tooth profile under the different wear cycles are obtained. A surrogate model which can describe the relation between wear and gear parameters is constructed based on the Kriging and artificial neural network method, the approximation level and goodness of fit among different Kriging models with different samples are studied. As shown in a numerical example, the wear depth tends to accumulate as wear cycles and are varying over the teeth flanks with minimum wear at the pitch and increase as the meshing point moves towards the root. By comparison of three Kriging models with different original sample numbers, the minimum sample number is 100 if the approximation level and goodness of fit meet the demands. The Kriging model has high computational efficiency and accuracy and can overcome time-consuming defect. © 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of Harbin Institute of Technology. All right reserved.},

abstract={This work explained the effects of solid-state phase transformation (SSPT) on welding residual stress (WRS) evolution in SA508 Gr.3 C1.1(SA508) ferritic steel single-pass and multi-pass weldments. A thermo-mechanical-metallurgical (TMM) model incorporating thermo-elastic-plastic stains and SSPT-related strains was presented. The SSPT kinetics and transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) models of SA508 steel were established by employing user-defined subroutines developed for ABAQUS. The simulated WRS distribution in the single-pass weldment was compared with previously published neutron diffraction measurement data, and a good agreement was achieved and thus validating the developed TMM model. The microstructural and WRS distribution characteristics of the multi-pass weldment were further investigated based on the validated TMM model. Numerical simulations illustrated how the transformation and heat transfer/cumulative behavior associated with different welding process conditions resulted in the generation of triaxial compressive and tensile stresses in the upper and underlying weld beads at the multi-pass welded joint, respectively. Moreover, an additional simulation model with SSPT but without TRIP was developed to reveal the potential effects of TRIP on WRS distribution. This study numerically provided valuable understanding of microstructure and WRS evolution in air cooling bainitic steel weldments under multiple thermal cycles and constituted a fundamental basis for developing new welding materials to minimize the formation of deleterious tensile WRS by simultaneously combining bainitic and martensitic transformations. © 2020},

abstract={This paper proposes the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) for solving one of the ongoing research challenges in finite set-model predictive control (FS-MPC) of power electronics converters, i.e., the automated selection of weighting factors in cost function. The first step in this approach is to simulate a detailed converter circuit model or run experiments numerous times using different weighting factor combinations. The key performance metrics [e.g., average switching frequency (fsw) of the converter, total harmonic distortion, etc.] are extracted from each simulation. This data is then used to train the ANN, which serves as a surrogate model of the converter that can provide fast and accurate estimates of the performance metrics for any weighting factor combination. Consequently, any arbitrary user-defined fitness function that combines the output metrics can be defined and the weighting factor combinations that optimize the given function can be explicitly found. The proposed methodology was verified on a practical weighting factor design problem in FS-MPC regulated voltage source converter for uninterruptible power supply system. Designed weighting factors for two exemplary fitness functions turned out to be robust to load variations and to yield close to expected performance when applied both to detailed simulation model (less than 3% error) and to experimental test bed (less than 10% error). © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={To improve the vehicle lightweight and crashworthiness, a design strategy for the characteristics of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite anti-collision beam structure was proposed based on grey relational analysis with the entropy weight method. A numerical simplified model considering the actual working condition of the whole vehicle was established. The mechanical properties of the material were determined by the mechanical properties test of carbon fiber reinforced plastics, which provides accurate material property for the carbon fiber bumper anti-collision beam model under collision conditions. The Hammersley experimental design method can generate 60 sample points to establish the relationship between design variables and responses based on the frontal collision simulation model. The entropy weight method was used to determine the weight of each response index, and the crashworthiness and lightweight of the composite anti-collision beam were optimized by the grey relational analysis method. The optimal size parameter combination of the anti-collision beam structure was obtained and the optimization scheme was determined. The results show that the optimal model peak energy absorption is increased by 11.4%, the peak force is reduced by 48%, and the mass is reduced by 56.5% compared with the initial model. The method achieves lightweight optimization design for the vehide under the premise that the safety index is satisfied. © 2020, Editorial Office of Acta Materiae Compositae Sinica.

abstract={Typhoons can have disastrous effects on power systems. They may lead to a large number of power outages for distribution network users. Therefore, this paper establishes a model to predict the power outage quantity of distribution network users under a typhoon disaster. Firstly, twenty-six explanatory variables (called global variables) covering meteorological factors, geographical factors, and power grid factors are considered as the input variables. On this basis, the correlation between each explanatory variable and response variable is analyzed. Secondly, we established a global variable model to predict the power outage quantity of distribution network users based on Random Forest (RF) algorithm. Then the importance of each explanatory variable is mined to extract the most important variables. To reduce the complexity of the model and ease the burden of data collection, eight variables are eventually selected as important variables. Afterward, we predict the power outage quantity of distribution network users again using the eight important variables. Thirdly, we compare the prediction accuracy of a model called the No-model that has been used before, Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), RF-global variable model, and RF-important variable model. Simulation results show that the RF-important variable model proposed in this paper has a better effect. Since fewer variables can save prediction time and make the model simplified, it is recommended to use the RF-important variable model. © 2021 Min Li et al.},

abstract={Abrupt distortions can appear as a result of transient crosswind or during rapid aircraft maneuvers. Such distortions are known to reduce the aerodynamic stability of engines and therefore present a major concern to all aero-engine manufacturers. To assess the aerodynamic stability of fan blades due to distortions, rig tests are usually carried out to establish the loss in stall margin. In such test campaigns, an exit duct (which is followed by a nozzle) is placed downstream of the fan blade and the operating condition of the fan is controlled by this nozzle. It is shown in this paper that in such rig tests the length of duct downstream of a fan has a significant impact on fan stall margin. The key contributor for such interaction is the dynamic response of the exit duct and the aerodynamic stability of the fan is affected by the acoustic reflection from the exit nozzle. To study the underlying physics, transient response in the exit duct downstream of a transonic fan stage was studied numerically using a simplified model. Simulation results, along with calculations based on analytical theories, confirmed the generation, propagation and reflection of waves induced by the inlet distortion. A quantitative relationship concerning the lengths of the compression system is introduced which determines whether a duct setup would have beneficial or detrimental influences on compressor aerodynamic stability. The findings of this research have great implications for the stability assessment of fans as the stability margin can be affected by the waves generated in bypass ducts. Copyright © 2019 ASME.},

abstract={Most open repositories present a similar interface and workflow to publish data resultant from different types of research methods. Publishing simulation datasets is challenging due to the iterative nature of simulations that generate large numbers and sizes of files, and their need for detailed documentation. DesignSafe is a web-based open platform for natural hazards engineering research where users can conduct simulations in high performance computing resources, curate, and publish their data. Working closely with experts, we completed a data design project for curation and representation of simulation datasets. The design involved the creation of a data and metadata model that captures the main processes, data, and documentation used in natural hazards simulation research. The model became the foundation to design an interactive curation pipeline integrated with the rest of the platform functions. In the curation interface, users are guided to move, select, categorize, describe, and register relations between files corresponding to the simulation model, the inputs and the outputs categories. Curation steps can be undertaken at any time during active research. To engage users, the web interactions were designed to facilitate managing large numbers of files. The resultant data landing pages show the structure and metadata of a simulation process both as a tree, and a browsing interface for understandability and ease of access. To evaluate the design, we mapped real simulation data to interactive mockups and sought out experts' feed-back. Upon implementing a first release of the pipeline, we evaluated the data publications and made necessary enhancements. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={The seepage flow beneath a hydraulic structure is formed by the hydraulic head difference between the upstream and downstream sides. Cut-off walls are often applied, as an expedience, to reduce the seepage flow through the foundation of diversion dams and to enhance the efficiency of these dams. In this research, perhaps for the first time, a novel methodology is propounded to assess the optimum characteristics of cut-off walls in diversion dams in order to ameliorate hydraulic interactions between the diversion dam foundation and the cut-off walls behavior, also their construction cost is minimized. The results are used to train and validate the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) simulation model. Then MLP, as a meta-model for simulation of the hydraulic behavior of cut-off walls, is coupled with a robust multi-objective optimization algorithm, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-ΙΙ (NSGA-ΙΙ), to create a trade-off between the intended goals. Finally, Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) decision making model and Nash-Harsanyi bargaining model are utilized to find the compromise design optimal solution on the trade-off curve. Results demonstrate that the best agreed-upon design optimal solution using PROMETHEE and Nash-Harsanyi bargaining models can be considered as (10, 3.84, 32) meters and (2.47, 10, 29.22) meters for optimum depth of the upstream and downstream cut-off walls and the optimum distance between them, respectively. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Evapotranspiration (ET) is the most dominant hydrologic process in water balance, yet it is difficult to measure in a watershed. This feature of ET has resulted in the development of many ET equations to estimate ET indirectly. While developing the Watershed Processes Simulation (WAPROS) model, the need for incorporating a good ET procedure is keenly felt, as the main objective is to simulate water balance of the watershed. Among many alternatives, ensemble estimate procedure is selected, for which six ET equations have been chosen. As the input data requirement for ET equations are highly demanding, the ET equations have been modified to dispense with some unimportant data, retaining the validity of the estimate. The details of selected ET equations and the method of ensemble are discussed. The method of disaggregation of potential ET into potential evaporation and potential transpiration has been discussed. As the WAPROS model has been planned as an hourly simulation model, the method of disaggregation of daily ET data into hourly ET data also assumed more importance. In this model, hourly distribution of potential values has been disaggregated into 24 hours for evaporation and 12 hours (daylight) for transpiration. As measured data for actual ET are not available, simulated ET data cannot be compared directly. It requires comprehensive sensitivity analysis of ET equations and estimate of the ensemble method. The sensitivities of ET and hydrologic processes to changes in air temperature are also incorporated. New metrics to aid in sensitivity analysis have been introduced to capture the quantum of changes. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Streamwater pollution by pesticides is a critical environmental issue in farmed catchment areas. Many important factors are involved in this pollution phenomenon, like weather, area topology, land use and crop management practices, which all influence streamwater quality. The purpose of the ongoing study presented in this paper is to evaluate the impact of land use and management practices on streamwater pollution. We use modelling, simulation and machine learning techniques for acquiring knowledge about this complex domain. Our main objective is to learn qualitative rules relating the pollution factors to the temporal distribution of the stream pesticide concentration. The study area is the farmed catchment of Fremeur (~17 km2), located in Brittany, France. Our approach relies on a simulation model, called SACADEAU, which is based on two main components: a biophysical transfer model and a decision model. The biophysical transfer model simulates pesticide transfer through the catchment, from application sites on maize parcels, to the river. The decision model simulates farm management practices such as tillage, sowing, and pesticide application. The two other components of the SACADEAU model include a climate model which provides daily rainfall and temperature, and a spatial model which describes land use and catchment topology (Figure 1). This simulation model is used for generating a large number of scenarios of the catchment system, considering different weather series or spatial distributions of land use and agricultural activities. Machine learning techniques were used to interpret the very complex and large set of results. ICL, an inductive logic programming software, generated a set of simple rules which described the factors influencing streamwater contamination. This demonstrated that soil characteristics, and in particular organic carbon content, are a key factor controlling contamination. Other important factors are: type of pesticide used, timing and quantity of rainfall, and topology of the catchment. The Sacadeau model is not yet fully implemented and The first results have been obtained with a simplified model. We were able to check the coherence and the feasibility of our approach, and to build a first view of the role of some attributes in stream-water quality. When the SACADEAU model is fully operational, it should be possible to develop more specific rules that incorporate a greater level of details about spatial and temporal variations. © MODSIM 2005 - International Congress on Modelling and Simulation: Advances and Applications for Management and Decision Making, Proceedings.

abstract={A platform for the engineering design, performance, and control of an adaptive wind turbine blade is presented. This environment includes a simulation model, integrative design tool, and control framework. The authors are currently developing a novel blade with an adaptive twist angle distribution (TAD). The TAD influences the aerodynamic loads and thus, system dynamics. The modeling platform facilitates the use of an integrative design tool that establishes the TAD in relation to wind speed. The outcome of this design enables the transformation of the TAD during operation. Still, a robust control method is required to realize the benefits of the adaptive TAD. Moreover, simulation of the TAD is computationally expensive. It also requires a unique approach for both partial and full-load operation. A framework is currently being developed to relate the TAD to the wind turbine and its components. Understanding the relationship between the TAD and the dynamic system is crucial in the establishment of real-time control. This capability is necessary to improve wind capture and reduce system loads. In the current state of development, the platform is capable of maximizing wind capture during partial-load operation. However, the control tasks related to Region 3 and load mitigation are more complex. Our framework will require high-fidelity modeling and reducedorder models that support real-time control. The paper outlines the components of this framework that is being developed. The proposed platform will facilitate expansion and the use of these required modeling techniques. A case study of a 20 kW system is presented based upon the partial-load operation. The study demonstrates how the platform is used to design and control the blade. A low-dimensional aerodynamic model characterizes the blade performance. This interacts with the simulation model to predict the power production. The design tool establishes actuator locations and stiffness properties required for the blade shape to achieve a range of TAD configurations. A supervisory control model is implemented and used to demonstrate how the simulation model blade performs in the case study. Copyright © 2018 ASME},

Based on the modal parameters identified in the tests, the stiffness matrix and damping matrix of mass-spring-damper model are fixed, and the dynamic differential equation is set up, thus calculating the modal parameters and frequency response functions of the building bending vibration. Simulink dynamic simulation model is established based on the dynamic differential equation of mass-spring-damper model. The overall vibration response law of high-rise buildings under the action of tunnel blasting seismic is analyzed by taking the velocity signal of blasting vibration as exciting signal. The results show that the vertical vibration is the largest, the longitudinal vibration is the second and the tangential vibration is the smallest under the action of blasting vibration of subway tunnel, and the lateral vibration velocity is not much different from the tangential vibration velocity at the higher floors; on the higher floors, the vibration velocity peak fluctuates with the increase in floor and is interrelated to the main modal shape, and the peak distribution of vibration velocities shows this correlation; and the high-rise building is simplified to a mass-spring-damper model, and a mathematical model of dynamic reaction is set up, and then Simulink simulation model is established for simulation calculation. This method can effectively predict the response of the structure under blasting vibration. © 2018, Editorial Board of Acta Armamentarii. All right reserved.},

abstract={In flood risk management, the divergent concept of resilience of a flood defense system cannot be fully defined quantitatively by one indicator and multiple indicators need to be considered simultaneously. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) design framework is developed to determine the optimal protection level of a levee system based on different resilience indicators that depend on the probabilistic features of the flood damage cost arising under the uncertain nature of rainfalls. An evolutionary-based MOO algorithm is used to find a set of non-dominated solutions, known as Pareto optimal solutions for the optimal protection level. The objective functions, specifically resilience indicators of severity, variability and graduality, that account for the uncertainty of rainfall can be evaluated by stochastic sampling of rainfall amount together with the model simulations of incurred flood damage estimation for the levee system. However, these model simulations which usually require detailed flood inundation simulation are computationally demanding. This hinders the wide application of MOO in flood risk management and is circumvented here via a surrogate flood damage modeling technique that is integrated into the MOO algorithm. The proposed optimal design framework is applied to a levee system in a central basin of flood-prone Jakarta, Indonesia. The results suggest that the proposed framework enables the application of MOO with resilience objectives for flood defense system design under uncertainty and solves the decision making problems efficiently by drastically reducing the required computational time. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The temperature drop of waxy crude oil after a shutdown is the basic premise for restarting relative mechanical calculation. However, computational accuracy has been paid much more attention excessively in the relevant techniques proposed in the previous researches for this calculation but ignoring the practicability of the calculation results. In this paper a new mathematical model is established for a buried hot crude oil pipeline during shutdown with the simplified complex physical process of oil cooling process reasonably, in which the heat transfer mode of crude oil is divided into pure convection heat transfer and pure heat conduction with stagnation point temperature neglecting the difference of radial temperature. The quasi periodic property theory of soil temperature field is referenced to be as the boundary condition for the thermal influence region. A numerical solution with a structured grid and an analytical solution under polar coordinate are respectively applied for the soil region and other regions including pipe wall, wax layer and insulation layer. The finite volume method is adopted to discretize the heat transfer control equation at the same time the boundary conditions are treated by the additional source term method. The simulation results of the new model are verified by a temperature field tested experiment, especially analyzing the temperature deviation between the simulation and the equivalent mean value of actual oil temperature. At last the effect of buried depth of pipeline on the temperature profiles during normal operation and the temperature drop process of crude oil were investigated based on the simplified model.

abstract={As a phase change evaporator, a microchannel array heat exchanger is of great significance in the field of microscale heat dissipation. The performance of which strongly depends on the flow resistance, capillary force, and other factors. In order to improve the heat dissipation efficiency, it is necessary to perform an in-depth study of the characteristics of microchannel flow using numerical simulation. However, the current simulation model requires high computational cost and long simulation time. To solve this problem, this paper simplifies the numerical simulation of the rectangular parallel array microchannels by building the basic flow model based on the concept of porous media. In addition, we explore the effect of aspect-ratio (AR), hydraulic diameter, inlet velocity, and other parameters of fluid flow behavior inside the microchannels. Meanwhile, a user-defined function (UDF) is formulated to add the capillary force into the model to introduce capillary force into the porous media model. Through the above research, the paper establishes the porous media model for single-phase and gas-liquid two-phase flow, which acts as a simplification of microchannel array simulation without grossly affecting the results obtained. In addition, we designed and manufactured experiments using silicon-based microchannel heat exchangers with different-ratios, and combined with the visualization method to measure the performance of the device and compared them with simulation results. The theoretical model is verified through the suction experiment of array microchannel evaporator capillary core. The simplified model of microchannel array significantly saves the computational cost and time, and provides guidance for the related experimental researches. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Model-based system simulations play a critical role in the development process of the automotive industry. They are highly instrumental in developing embedded control systems during conception, design, validation, and deployment stages. Whether for model-in-the-loop (MiL), software-in-the-loop (SiL) or hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) scenarios, high-fidelity plant models are particularly valuable for generating realistic simulation results that can parallel or substitute for costly and time-consuming vehicle field tests. In this paper, the development of a powertrain plant model and its correlation performance are presented. The focus is on the following modules of the propulsion systems: Transmission, driveline, and vehicle. The physics and modeling approach of the modules is discussed, and the implementation is illustrated in Amesim software. The developed model shows good correlation performance against test data in dynamic events such as launch, tip-in, tip-out, and gearshifts. To quantify the correlation accuracy, metrics are defined to provide a numerical assessment of plant model behavior and accuracy. In this study the engine is treated as a torque source, to concentrate on transmission, driveline, and vehicle dynamics. If necessary, a full-fledged engine model based on GT-Power can be connected through co-simulation interface. Co-simulation of software from different vendors greatly expands the plant modeling capability and the flexibility of coupling with controllers. Co-simulated models for both SiL and HiL purposes are discussed, with the focus on the interface options, cosim running configurations, model reduction, and bench validation. Although the vehicle modeled here has a conventional powertrain with an automatic transmission, the modeling architecture and correlation methodology can be readily applied to alternative propulsion systems. © 2020 General Motors.},

abstract={With the rapidly developing automotive industry and stricter environmental protection laws and regulations, lightweight materials, advanced manufacturing processes and structural optimization methods are widely used in body design. Therefore, in order to evaluate and improve the pedestrian protection during a collision, this paper presents an impact simulation modeling and structural optimization method for a sport utility vehicle engine hood made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP). Head injury criterion (HIC) was used to evaluate the performance of the hood in this regard. The inner panel and the outer panel of CFRP hood were discretized by shell elements in LS-DYNA. The Mat54-55 card was used to define the mechanical properties of the CFRP hood. In order to reduce the computational costs, just the parts contacted with the hood were modeled. The simulations were done in the prescribed 30 impact points. In order to validate the reduced finite element model, pedestrian impact tests were carried out. To further improve the performance in terms of pedestrian safety, CFRP layers were added to strengthen the outer panel. A parametric optimization was carried out. Surrogate model was constructed by three approximation approaches and the errors were compared. Four algorithms were utilized to solve the optimization problem. The best optimization is done through Kriging model approximation and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-the third version (NSGA-III). The optimal design is relatively light and reduces the HIC value of the critical point from 2397 to 876. This method can be a useful tool for pedestrian protection and related works. © 2020 SAE International. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Vacuum assisted resin transfer molding is a promising process in advanced composite manufacturing with a wide range of applications in industry. That potential is often misused, though, because of the lack of an efficient and reliable simulation tool to support product development. Most of the simulation methods in use today are based on Darcy’s law, which explains the permeation of a fluid in a porous medium. However, it is known that this law has limitations when applied to the context of dual-scale fibrous reinforcements: macro porosity given by fiber architecture generates resistance to flow, while the inner porosity inherent to fiber tows causes it to absorb resin, affecting the flow. The latter effect cannot be explained by traditional theory. In order to explore these limitations, this work proposes a simplified model to vacuum assisted resin transfer molding process from the point of view of system dynamics, and to prove the viability of such theory. The ultimate goal is to propose a more complete model in light of system dynamics that saves time and cost while offering the same reliability as current simulation models. In order to provide an explanation to both dual-scale phenomena, a parallel association between a resistance and a fluid capacitance is proposed. Model validation is then performed through the analysis of experimental data followed by the comparison between the Darcy infusion profile and the one predicted by the resistor-capacitor-parallel (RC-parallel) circuit model. Thus, this work is able to perform a proof of concept that leads to a novel and yet unexplored field of study. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Data driven model identification methods have grown increasingly popular due to enhancements in measuring devices and data mining. They provide a useful approach for comparing the performance of a device to the simplified model that was used in the design phase. One of the modern, popular methods for model identification is Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). Although this approach has been widely investigated in the literature using mostly numerical models, its applicability and performance with physical systems is still a topic of current research. In this paper we extend SINDy to identify the mathematical model of a complicated physical experiment of a chaotic pendulum with a varying potential interaction. We also test the approach using a simulated model of a nonlinear, simple pendulum. The input to the approach is a time series, and estimates of its derivatives. While the standard approach in SINDy is to use the Total Variation Regularization (TVR) for derivative estimates, we show some caveats for using this route, and we benchmark the performance of TVR against other methods for derivative estimation. Our results show that the estimated model coefficients and their resulting fit are sensitive to the selection of the TVR parameters, and that most of the available derivative estimation methods are easier to tune than TVR. We also highlight other guidelines for utilizing SINDy to avoid overfitting, and we point out that the fitted model may not yield accurate results over long time scales. We test the performance of each method for Address all correspondence to this author. noisy data sets and provide both experimental and simulation results. We also post the files needed to build and reproduce our experiment in a public repository. Copyright © 2020 ASME.},

abstract={Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory central detector is located 700 m below the ground and also submerged into an ultrapure water pool. The main structure of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory central detector is a hybrid spherical shell that is vulnerable to rotation under the buoyancy effect. The influences of the model parameters on the rotational stability of this complex and unique structure are investigated. Since the model parameters are inevitably subjected to many sources of uncertainties (e.g. manufacturing tolerances and geometrical imperfections), the parameter uncertainty is taken into account. In addition, linear and nonlinear rotational stabilities of this super-deep underground spherical structure are also under consideration. Specifically, the critical loading multiplier is used as the evaluation indicator of linear rotational stability and the load proportionality factor-θ curve is considered as the evaluation indicator of nonlinear rotational stability. The sensitivity of linear and nonlinear rotational stabilities to uncertain parameters is systematically studied in terms of univariate and multivariate global sensitivity analyses. The univariate global sensitivity analysis is able to evaluate the effects of uncertain parameters on each evaluation indicator, whereas multivariate global sensitivity analysis enables to assess the global influence of uncertain parameters on all evaluation indicators. A polynomial chaos expansion surrogate model is utilized to replace the time-consuming simulation model for analytical implementation of the univariate and multivariate global sensitivity analyses. The present polynomial chaos expansion-based univariate and multivariate global sensitivity analyses effectively and efficiently reveal the sensitivity of the rotational stability of this super-deep underground spherical structure to uncertain parameters, and provide a practical method for comprehensive sensitivity analysis of similar structures. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Evaluating and testing cardiac electrical devices in a closed-physiologic-loop can help design safety, but this is rarely practical or comprehensive. Furthermore, in silico closed-loop testing with biophysical computer models cannot meet the requirements of time-critical cardiac device systems, while simplified models meeting time-critical requirements may not have the necessary dynamic features. We propose a new high-level (abstracted) physiologically-based computational heart model that is time-critical and dynamic. Methods: The model comprises cardiac regional cellular-electrophysiology types connected by a path model along a conduction network. The regional electrophysiology and paths are modeled with hybrid automata that capture non-linear dynamics, such as action potential and conduction velocity restitution and overdrive suppression. The hierarchy of pacemaker functions is incorporated to generate sinus rhythms, while abnormal automaticity can be introduced to form a variety of arrhythmias such as escape ectopic rhythms. Model parameters are calibrated using experimental data and prior model simulations. Conclusion: Regional electrophysiology and paths in the model match human action potentials, dynamic behavior, and cardiac activation sequences. Connected in closed loop with a pacing device in DDD mode, the model generates complex arrhythmia such as atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia. Such device-induced outcomes have been observed clinically and we can establish the key physiological features of the heart model that influence the device operation. Significance: These findings demonstrate how an abstract heart model can be used for device validation and to design personalized treatment. © 1964-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new passive control device, pendulum-pounding tuned mass damper (PPTMD), to mitigate the response of lightly damped structures under various excitations. The proposed PPTMD consists of a tuned pendulum mass and a pounding boundary next to the equilibrium position of the pendulum mass. Moreover, a layer of viscoelastic materials called high energy-dissipation rubber is attached on the pounding boundary to dissipate the vibration energy through impacts. A simplified impact force model was developed for modeling the pounding behavior of the high energy-dissipation rubber pounding layer, and parameters in the simplified model were identified from free pounding experiments. The validation of the numerical method to simulate the dynamic behavior of the PPTMD was provided. The effectiveness of the PPTMD to control a single degree-of-freedom structure was numerically and experimentally studied under free vibration and forced vibration. The effects of the frequency tuning ratio, the coefficient of restitution, the excitation force amplitude, and the mass ratio were studied, respectively. Finally, the control performance of the PPTMD was compared with the classic tuned mass damper under free vibration, forced vibration, and several earthquake records. It is shown that the PPTMD can significantly increase the damping ratio of the controlled structure and effectively reduce the response of the controlled structure around the resonant frequency range. Furthermore, the PPTMD still achieves considerable control performance even if the frequency of the controlled structure varied in a wide range. Due to the different vibration control mechanism, the PPTMD outperforms the classic resonant frequency range in controlling the structural displacement response. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={In this article, we devise a nonlinear model predictive control framework for the energy management of nonhybrid hydrostatic drive transmissions. The controller determines the optimal control commands of the actuators by minimising a cost function over a receding horizon. With our approach, the velocity-tracking error is minimised while keeping the fuel economy of the system high. The hydrostatic drive transmission system studied in this article is a typical commercial work machine, that is, there is no energy storage or alternative power source in the system (a nonhybrid hydrostatic drive transmission). We evaluate success with a validated simulation model of the hydrostatic drive transmission of a municipal tractor. In our experiments, a detailed system model is used both in the system simulation and in the prediction phase of the nonlinear model predictive control. The use of a detailed model in the nonlinear model predictive control framework places our design as a benchmark for controlling nonhybrid hydrostatic drive transmissions, when compared to solutions using simplified models or computationally less intensive control methods as in earlier work by the authors. Our nonlinear model predictive control approach enables numerically robust optimisation convergence with the utilised complex nonlinear model. Above all, this is accomplished with stabilising terminal constraints and distinctive terminal cost, both based on an optimal steady-state solution. In addition, a simple method to generate initial guesses for optimisation is introduced. When compared with the performance of a controller based on quasi-static models, our results show notable improvement in velocity tracking while maintaining high fuel economy. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that framing energy management as a nonlinear model predictive control provides a flexible and rigorous framework for fast velocity tracking and high energy efficiency. We also compare the results with those of an industrial baseline controller. © IMechE 2018.},

abstract={While optimization studies focusing on real-world buildings are somewhat limited, many building optimization studies to date have used simple hypothetical buildings for the following three reasons: (1) the shape and form of real buildings are complex and difficult to mathematically describe; (2) computer models built based on real buildings are computationally expensive, which makes the optimization process time-consuming and impractical and (3) although algorithm performance is crucial for achieving effective building performance optimization (BPO), there is a lack of agreement regarding the proper selection of optimization algorithms and algorithm control parameters. This study applied BPO to the design of a newly built complex building. A number of design variables, including the shape of the building's eaves, were optimized to improve building energy efficiency and indoor thermal comfort. Instead of using a detailed simulation model, a surrogate model developed by an artificial neural network (ANN) was used to reduce the computing time. In this study, the performance of four multi-objective algorithms was evaluated by using the proposed performance evaluation criteria to select the best algorithm and parameter values for population size and number of generations. The performance evaluation results of the algorithms implied that NSGA-II (with a population size and number of generations of 40 and 45, respectively) performed the best in the case study. The final optimal solution significantly improves building performance, demonstrating the success of the BPO technique in solving complex building design problems. In addition, the findings on the performance evaluation of the algorithms provide guidance for users regarding the selection of suitable algorithms and parameter settings based on the most important performance criteria. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The most challenging task in the agricultural sector is to accurately predict crop yield. A typical machine learning algorithm often uses real data to predict crop yield. In this study, we used data generated by the Wild Blueberry Pollination Model, a spatially explicit simulation model validated by field observation and experimental data collected in Maine USA during the last 30 years. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the relative importance of bee species composition and weather factors in regulating wild blueberry agroecosystems. Specifically, we sought to reveal how bee species composition and weather affect yield and to predict optimal bee species composition and weather conditions that achieve the best yield using computer simulation and machine learning algorithms. Multiple linear regression (MLR), boosted decision trees (BDT), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated as predictive tools. We also performed a predictor selection before submitting our data to the learning algorithms. In this way, we are able to reduce the dimension of the input without a significant drop in prediction accuracy. As a result, clone size, honeybee, bumblebee, Andrena bee species, Osmia bee species, maximum of upper-temperature ranges, and the number of days with precipitation were chosen as the best predictor variable subset. The results showed that the XGBoost outperformed other algorithms in all measures of model performance for predicting the yield of wild blueberry by achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.938, root mean square error (RMSE) of 343.026, mean absolute error (MAE) of 206 and relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 5.444%. The results are consistent with previous work on predicting wild blueberry fruit yield using digital color photography by (Zaman et al., 2008). This study showed that crop yield predictions can be based on computer simulation modeling datasets. Therefore, if a reasonable prediction can be reached, this study should have a significant impact, especially when data collection in the field is challenging. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Temperature is a key variable for the modeling of geological CO2 storage, and any simulation model must take it explicitly or implicitly into account. At the large spatial scales and low flow rates associated with CO2 migration studies, temperature can be reasonably considered as an constant and imposed external field, with CO2 and brine assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding rock. Closer to an injection well, the picture is different. CO2 may be injected at a temperature significantly different from that of the aquifer, leading to an expanding thermal front around the injection well. The local change in temperature not only affects fluid properties, but also geomechanical stresses and the rate of geochemical reactions. In this article, we examine whether certain simplified approaches used to simulate CO2 storage at the large scale may be adapted and applied to model the regions affected by the thermal front. We do this by comparing the results from upscaled (vertically integrated) flow models extended with heat transport and different choices of overburden representations against highly resolved 3D models. The considered test cases have been constructed to minimize or maximize specific characteristics of the coupled flow-thermal system: the Peclet number, the gravity number and the amount of thermal bleed. Our results suggest that for several practical cases the thermal front can be reasonably well modeled using a vertically integrated flow model with constant vertical temperature. The results also suggest that a simplified overburden representation may give a reasonable approximation, particularly for scenarios with low thermal bleed. We point out that the impact of a simplified overburden representation can be very similar to the use of linear heat transfer coefficients. On the other hand, while models that completely neglect thermal bleed may perform acceptably in some low-bleed settings, they often lead to very large errors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Contribution of pollution from pesticides is often located to minor areas within a field. Areas with coarse textured materials in the soil profile often represent”hot spots” with high risk of leaching, but also areas with example structured clay soils may be “hot spots”. Other areas can be slopes or bottoms in depressions on plateaus were water can be ponded in wet periods or in springtime before the frost has disappeared from the soil profile. If pesticides with high risk of leaching were avoided on these areas, the contribution to groundwater pollution could be reduced extensively. Up to now limited information or tools have been developed for farmers to identify these areas. In a newly completed project, tools for groundwater and surface water protection was developed and evaluated. Three different types of tools have been developed: Topographical maps, risk tables and risk maps. Micro-topographical maps were developed to identify depressions and other vulnerable areas representing high risk of leaching and runoff. Tables of pesticide leaching risk to drainage and groundwater were derived from model simulations in spring cereals and potatoes with the mostly used plant protection strategies on the most common soil types for the areas. A meta-model was used for calculation of pesticide concentrations in groundwater and drainage water, coupled with digital soil maps and presented by Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Farmers from two areas evaluated the usefulness of these tools. Generally the farmers' attitudes to the new tools were positive, but this type of information should be integrated in already existing planning tools at the farm, like fertilizer planning. The project produces large amounts of information and an electronic presentation readily understood and easy to follow is important. In some cases different soil types and topography within the farm represented different risk of leaching. In such cases, it is necessary to easily find pesticides to be used for all areas to avoid time consuming washing and change of equipment. © MODSIM 2009.All rights reserved.},

In several arid and semi-arid parts of the world, groundwater resources are being used as an alternative source of freshwater. Excessive and/or unplanned groundwater withdrawals have a negative impact on the aquifer. Groundwater withdrawn from coastal aquifers are susceptible to contamination by saltwater intrusion. This study investigates the efficiency and viability of using artificial freshwater recharge (AFR) to increase fresh groundwater pumping from production wells for beneficial use. A three dimensional (3D), transient, density dependent, finite element based flow and transport model of an illustrative coastal aquifer is implemented using FEMWATER code. First, the effect of AFR on inland encroachment of saline water is quantified for existing scenarios. Specifically, groundwater head and salinity concentration differences at monitoring locations before and after artificial recharge is presented. Second, a multi-objective management model incorporating groundwater pumping and AFR is implemented to control groundwater salinization in an illustrative coastal aquifer system. To avoid computational burden and ensure computational feasibility, the numerical flow and transport simulation model is substituted by the new support vector regression (SVR) predictive models as approximate simulators in the simulation–optimization framework for developing optimal management strategies. The performance evaluation results indicated that the SVR models were adequately trained and were capable of approximating saltwater intrusion processes in the aquifer. Multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is used to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The Pareto-optimal front obtained as solution from the SVR–MOGA optimization model presented a set of optimal solutions needed for the sustainable management of the coastal aquifer. The pumping strategies obtained as Pareto optimal solutions with and without freshwater recharge wells showed that saltwater intrusion is sensitive to the AFR. Also, the hydraulic head lenses created by AFR can be used as one practical option to control saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. The developed 3D saltwater intrusion model, predictive capability of the developed SVR models and the feasibility of using the proposed linked multi-objective SVR–MOGA optimization model makes the proposed methodology potentially attractive in solving large scale regional saltwater intrusion management problems. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This study presents a novel framework to optimize Low Impact Development (LID) practices for urban storm water management. First, the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) model was executed for different possible scenarios of input parameters and various LIDs to simulate runoff volume, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) loads. Next, a neural network (MLP-ANN) was trained and validated, as a surrogate model, against the set of inputs and output variables from the SWMM model simulations. The inherent uncertainties in the rainfall-runoff modeling were accounted for using a Nonlinear Interval Number Programming (NINP) model, and stakeholders' interactions are considered using a leader-follower game model. Velenjak urban watershed in Tehran, Iran, with four key stakeholders was considered as the study area. Tehran Municipality is the financial service provider that makes the first decision the leader-follower structure, and is considered as the leader with the priority of minimizing LIDs’ construction and maintenance costs. Tehran Department of Environmental Protection, Tehran Regional Water company, and Tehran Province Water and Wastewater company are the main followers in the decision making structure in the study area. This game theoretical framework yields several Pareto optimal solutions given the conflicting utilities of various players, and a Multi Criteria Decision Making procedure – i.e. PROMETHEE model – selects the most preferred compromised option. Fourteen weighting scenarios were considered in the PROMETHEE model to determine the compromise solution among the 52 solutions on the trade-off curve. The novelty of this study lies in using a nonlinear interval conflict resolution multi-objective optimization model for urban storm water management based on a leader-follower game. The proposed methodology warrants BOD and TSS loads, as well as storm water volume, are all reduced, with the highest reductions of 93, 86 and 90 percent, respectively. Results testify to the efficacy of the proposed model for urban storm water management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The equity of right-of-way is an important topic in traffic management and control. With the balance consideration of traffic equity and efficiency, which are respectively evaluated by the Atkinson index and average travel time, this study proposes a bi-objective signal timing simulation-based optimization (SO) model under uncertainties, and solve it by a bi-objective stochastic simulation-based optimization (BOSSO) method. In this method, two types of surrogate models (i.e., regressing Kriging model and quadratic regression model) are used to capture the complicated mapping relationship between decision variables and bi-objectives, respectively in the whole variable domain and in the local trust-region. Meanwhile, the incorporation of the global regressing Kriging model and an adaptive selector helps to predict bi-objective values of untested samples and re-estimate simulated samples in the local trust-region, which can save great computational costs and smooth stochastic noises. Moreover, the non-interactive role of a decision maker is taken to generate more Pareto optimal solutions around his/her desired bi-objective values. Through the algorithm comparison for a benchmark bi-objective stochastic optimization problem, the proposed BOSSO method is validated to outperform three other counterparts (i.e., NSGA-II, BOTR and BOEGO) under the same simulation costs. In real-field experiments, an urban road network with 15 signalized and five non-signalized intersections in Changsha, China is modeled by VISSIM. After the well calibration of the microscopic traffic simulation model, the network-wide bi-objective signal timing stochastic SO problems with and without coordination are solved by BOSSO. Numerical results indicate that compared with the real-field case, the average travel time and Atkinson index are reduced respectively by at most 13.48% and 23.49% for optimized non-coordinated signal plans, and respectively by at most 25.58% and 2.83% for optimized coordinated ones. It is further validated that under variable traffic volumes, the non-coordinated signal plan can well improve both traffic efficiency and equity, and the coordinated one is capable to improve traffic efficiency at a larger degree but sacrifice traffic equity. Moreover, the balance analyses show the existence of competing relationship between bi-objectives, and BOSSO is confirmed to outperform NSGA-II, BOTR and BOEGO in searching the better Pareto optimal signal plans under the same budged simulations. In conclusion, BOSSO is promising to address bi-objective optimization problems characterized by costly evaluation, high dimensions and stochastic noises. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A supervised machine learning technique namely an Adaptive Multiple Objective (AMO) optimization algorithm is used to divide a continuous and deterministic design space into non-dominated Pareto frontier and dominated design points. The effect of the initial training data quantity, i.e., computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results, on the Pareto frontier and output parameter sensitivity is explored. The optimization study is performed on a subsonic small-scale cavity-stabilized combustor. A parametric geometry is created using CAD that is coupled with a meshing software. The latter automatically transfers meshes and boundary conditions to the solver, which is coupled with a post-processing tool. Steady, incompressible three-dimensional simulations are performed using a multiphase realizable k-ε Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach with an adiabatic flamelet progress variable (FPV). Scalable wall functions are used for modeling turbulence near the wall. For each CFD simulation four levels of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) are utilized on the original cut-cell grid. The mesh is refined where the flow exhibits large progress variable curvature. There are fifteen geometrical input parameters and three output parameters, viz., a pattern factor proxy (maximum exit temperature), a combustion efficiency proxy (averaged exit temperature), and total pressure loss (TPL). The Pareto frontier and the input-to-output parameter sensitivities are reported for each meta-model simulation. For the investigated design space, three times the number of input parameters plus one (48) yields an optimization independent of the initial sampling. This conclusion is drawn by comparing the Pareto frontiers and global sensitivities. However, the latter provides a better metric. The relative influence of the input parameters on the outputs is assessed by using both a Spearman’s order-rank correlation approach as well as an active subspace analysis. In general, non-dominated design points exhibit persistent geometrical features such as offset opposed cavity forward and aft driver jet alignment. Larger cavities necessitate larger chutes and smaller outer liner jet diameters, whereas smaller cavities require smaller chutes and larger outer liner jet diameters. The fuel injector radial location varies, but can be located either radially inward or outward with respect to the forward dilution jet radial locations. For these non-dominated designs there is substantial burning inside and outside of the cavity. The downstream dilution jets quench the upstream hot gases. Copyright © 2019 ASME.},

abstract={The most commonly used definition of climate smart agriculture (CSA) is provided by the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations, which defines CSA as “agriculture that sustainably increases productivity, enhances resilience, reduces/removes greenhouse gas where possible, and enhances achievement of national food security and development goals”. In this definition, the principal goal of CSA is identified as food security and development, while productivity, adaptation, and mitigation are identified as the three interlinked pillars necessary for achieving this goal. In the context provided by the CSA, soils are seen as a lever to improve the carbon footprint of agriculture, namely through their role as carbon sinks. Improving soils and in particular agricultural soils’ content in soil organic carbon (SOC) in one of the measures enabling to improve the environmental impact of agricultural practices. In this context, composts can be seen as an important feedstock for sustainable farming. To support the development of organic amendment strategies enabling to increase soils’ SOC content, this work proposes a novel methodology to optimize the monthly scheduling of composts and mineral fertilizers amendments. The schedule proposed maximizes soil health - via improved SOC content - while ensuring optimal gross operating surplus from agriculture. This problem is subjected to certain operational, regulatory and soil-dynamics constraints which leads to a complex optimization problem and has to be solved in a relatively short time period for decision-making purposes. This is a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) which is based on a soil-simulation model from which the analytic functions are not explicitly available for the optimization model. Operational and regulatory constraints are explicitly defined and integer and continuous variables are needed in the modeling. In order to effectively solve it in a deterministic way, a novel surrogate-modeling approach for the objective functions and constraints is proposed. Another novelty comes from the implementation of a continuous-variable-reduction procedure in order to build effective surrogates. The optimisation model results obtained from a real case study show that local optimal solutions can be identified with short computation times. The evaluated scenario shows that the optimized strategy could increase by 8% the carbon in soil after 13 years while increasing by 7% the estimated agricultural profit when compared to expert based application schedules. © 2020 China Agricultural University},

abstract={The Mississippi River Delta ranks the seventh largest delta in the world. It provides a habitat for the Louisiana seafood industry, navigation canals and rivers that support five of the 15 largest cargo ports by volume in the United States, and hurricane storm surge protection for coastal cities and oil and gas industry infrastructure that facilitates 90% of the outer continental oil and gas extraction. Due to substantial coastal wetland loss since 1900, the risk of damage to these industries and infrastructure has increased through time. The goal of this research is to develop a methodology to analyze the historical and future evolution of coastal hazards, such as hurricane storm surge, across a complex, low-lying coastal landscape. To accomplish this task, the change in coastal hazards is analyzed through historical changes in coastal wetlands. Specifically, isopleths, defined as lines on a map indicating a constant value of a given variable, are developed to describe areas of constant values of the ratio of land to water (L:W) across coastal Louisiana. In this analysis, a methodology is developed that utilizes land to water (L:W) isopleths to simplify the modern day Louisiana coastal landscape as represented in a state-of-the-art high resolution storm surge model. L:W isopleths are derived for the year 2010 and used to construct 36 storm surge models, each featuring variations of three distinct coastal zones: “High” (i.e. high wetland), “Intermediate” (i.e. wetland), and “Submersed” (i.e. region between open water and wetland). The ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) code is used to compute water surface elevations and depth-averaged currents forced by hurricane wind and pressures from Hurricanes Rita, Gustav, and Katrina for each model. Peak water levels and volume of inundation are quantified within hydrologic unit code watersheds (HUC12) in order to compare storm surge models featuring high resolution and simplified coastal landscapes. A L:W isopleth permutation of 99%–90%–40%–1% with areas labeled “High” (99%–90%), “Intermediate” (90%–40%) and “Submersed” (40%–1%) is found to best represent simulated storm surge that most closely reproduces the high resolution storm surge model. Simulation results reveal the methodology developed in this analysis is effective in identifying an isopleth permutation that accurately simplifies a high resolution storm surge model. This result may lead to future analyses of the historical evolution of storm surge attenuation in the Mississippi River Delta (MRD) as well as other complex, low-lying deltas. These possibilities include developing storm surge models for the years 1930 and 1970, for instance, with the same isopleth permutation to examine the changes in storm surge attenuation through time. This analysis could also be applied in other similar low-lying coastal regions to conduct past and future analyses of the evolution of coastal hazards. © 2018},

abstract={Soft tissue neck injuries, also referred to as whiplash injuries, which can lead to long term suffering accounts for more than 60% of the cost of all injuries leading to permanent medical impairment for the insurance companies, with respect to injuries sustained in vehicle crashes. These injuries are sustained in all impact directions, however they are most common in rear impacts. Injury statistics have since the mid-1960s consistently shown that females are subject to a higher risk of sustaining this type of injury than males, on average twice the risk of injury. Furthermore, some recently developed anti-whiplash systems have revealed they provide less protection for females than males. The protection of both males and females should be addresses equally when designing and evaluating vehicle safety systems to ensure maximum safety for everyone. This is currently not the case. The norm for crash test dummies representing humans in crash test laboratories is an average male. The female part of the population is not represented in tests performed by consumer information organisations such as NCAP or in regulatory tests due to the absence of a physical dummy representing an average female. Recently, the world first virtual model of an average female crash test dummy was developed. In this study, simulations were run with both this model and an average male dummy model, seated in a simplified model of a vehicle seat. The results of the simulations were compared to earlier published results from simulations run in the same test set-up with a vehicle concepts seat. The three crash pulse severities of the Euro NCAP low severity rear impact test were applied. The motion of the neck, head and upper torso were analysed in addition to the accelerations and the Neck Injury Criterion (NIC). Furthermore, the response of the virtual models was compared to the response of volunteers as well as the average male model, to that of the response of a physical dummy model. Simulations with the virtual male and female dummy models revealed differences in dynamic response related to the crash severity, as well as between the two dummies in the two different seat models. For the comparison of the response of the virtual models to the response of the volunteers and the physical dummy model, the peak angular motion of the first thoracic vertebra as found in the volunteer tests and mimicked by the physical dummy were not of the same magnitude in the virtual models. The results of the study highlight the need for an extended test matrix that includes an average female dummy model to evaluate the level of occupant protection different seats provide in vehicle crashes. This would provide developers with an additional tool to ensure that both male and female occupants receive satisfactory protection and promote seat concepts that provide the best possible protection for the whole adult population. This study shows that using the mathematical models available today can provide insights suitable for future testing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},
