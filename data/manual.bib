abstract = {A discrete-event simulation (DES) of the network of primary health centers (PHCs) in a region can be used to evaluate the effect of changes in patient flow on operational outcomes across the network, and can also form the base simulation to which simulations of secondary and tertiary care facilities can be added. We present a DES of a network of PHCs using stochastic metamodels developed from more detailed DES models of PHCs (â€˜parent' simulations), which were developed separately for comprehensively analyzing individual PHC operations. The stochastic metamodels are DESs in their own right. They are simplified versions of the parent simulation with full-featured representations of only those components relevant to the analysis at hand. We show that the outputs of interest from the metamodels and the parent simulations (including the network simulations) are statistically similar and that our metamodel-based network simulation yields reductions of up to 80{\%} in runtimes.},

abstract = {Infineon Technologies Dresden has long used discrete event simulation to optimize production planning for its fully automated front end manufacturing lines. There are needs to reduce maintenance efforts, to increase transparency for validation and verification, and to improve flexibility for the fast simulation of scenarios with a focus on qualitative statements. Less detailed models will be utilized where components could be omitted. This paper considers a simplification of the process flows through operation substitution for constant delays. The main idea is to consider the accuracy measurements used to evaluate simplification. It is shown that standard accuracy measurements (e.g. mean absolute error, correlation coefficient, etc.) produce rather poor performance. It is suggested instead to use measurements based on lot cycle time distributions (e.g. goodness-of-fit tests). Nine types of simplification sieve functions were analyzed, with analyses based on the MIMAC dataset 5 model.},

abstract = {Removing bottlenecks that restrain the overall performance of a factory can give companies a competitive edge. Although in principle, it is possible to connect multiple detailed discrete-event simulation models to form a complete factory model, it could be too computationally expensive, especially if the connected models are used for simulation-based optimizations. Observing that computational speed of running a simulation model can be significantly reduced by aggregating multiple line-level models into an aggregated factory level, this paper investigates, with some loss of detail, if the identified bottleneck information from an aggregated factory model, in terms of which parameters to improve, would be useful and accurate enough when compared to the bottleneck information obtained with some detailed connected line-level models. The results from a real-world, multi-level industrial application study have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, showing that the aggregation method can represent the underlying detailed line-level model for bottleneck analysis.},
